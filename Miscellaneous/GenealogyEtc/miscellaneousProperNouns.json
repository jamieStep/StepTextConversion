//
//
// About this file
// ===============
//
// This file contains information about miscellaneous nouns appearing in the
//  OT and NT. Companion files are in preparation covering people and places.
//
// There is one master record for each noun.
//
//
//
// Identifiers
// ===========
//
// Each noun has a unique identifier made up of its English name followed by
// an @-sign, and then a scripture reference.  This combination is referred to
// here as a 'unified name'.
//
// Names are the ones used in the English Standard Version of the Bible (ESV).
//
// The first part of the scripture reference is the reference of the verse
// where the noun first appears.
//
// References are of the form bbb.cc.vv where bbb is the UBS (USX) abbreviation
// for the book, cc is the chapter number, and vv is the verse number.
//
// If the noun appears in more than one verse, the scripture reference is
// followed by a dash.
//
// If the noun appears in more than one book, the dash is followed by the
// abbreviated name of the last book.
//
// Thus we might have as unified names:
//
// * Stoic@Act.17.18      Stoic appears only once, in Act.17.18.
//
// * Ziv@1Ki.6.1-         Ziv appears for the first time in 1Ki.6.1.  It is also
//                        mentioned in various other verses, but all of them in
//                        1 Kings.
//
// * Zealot@Mat.10.4-Mrk  Zealot first appears in Mat.10.4, and is mentioned for
//                        teh last time in Acts.
//
//
//
// Information structure
// =====================
//
// Each noun has:
//
// * A master record which describes it.
//
// * One or more supplementary records giving additional information for each
//   name by which the noun is known.
//
// * A summary record which summarises the content of the supplementary records.
//
//
// These records are discussed in the following sections.
//
//
//
// Master record
// =============
//
// The master record comprises the following fields:
//
// * unifiedName: The unified name as discussed above.
//
// * baseNameFromUnifiedName: The name of the place as it appears in the unified
//   name, without the @-sign and the scripture reference.  This is the name
//   used in the ESV Bible.
//
// * referenceFromUnifiedName: The reference for the verse in which the name
//   first appears.
//
// * dStrongs: Disambiguated Strongs.  See www.TinyURL.com/STEP-Disambiguated.
//
// * description: A brief description.
//
// * summaryDescription: A slightly longer description
//
//
//
// Supplementary records
// =====================
//
// Each main record has one or more supplementary records to supply
// additional information.  There are various forms of supplementary
// record serving different purposes, but in essence, each covers a single
// name for the noun (thus catering for the possibility that the
// noun may be known by more than one name), and gives the name,
// associated Strong's information, a URL which displays in STEPBible the
// verses where the noun appears, and a list of references for those verses.
//
// We look at these individual fields in more detail later.  First, though,
// details of the supplementary records themselves.
//
// Each has a recordType field to indicate what purpose it serves.  These are as
// follows:
//
// * Named: Gives a name for the noun, along with information about that
//   noun and the verses where it is used.  If the noun first appears
//   in the OT, this will contain details for the a Hebrew or Aramaic form.  If
//   it first appears in the NT, it will contain details for a Greek form.
//
// * Group: Used where the noun also forms (perhaps in modified form) the name
//   of a group of people.
//
// * NameCombined: Used in place of a Named record where noun is known both
//   both by a 'simple' name and by a 'compound' name.
//
// * Greek: Where the ancient languages refer to a given noun using both a
//   Greek and a Hebrew version of its name, the Hebrew form is reflected
//   in a Named supplementary record, and the Greek details in an additional
//   Greek record.
//   
// * Aramaic: Analogous to the Greek record just discussed.
//
// * Spelled: Used in addition to Named records to indicate alternative
//   ancient-language spellings, which may be reflected in English.
//
// * SameFormAsPrevious: The Hebrew/Greek form is the same as in the preceding
//   supplementary record, but the references are different because the
//   translation in ESV (and sometimes in other Bibles) is different.
//
// * SameRefsAsPrevious: The references are the same in the preceding
//   supplementary record, but the Hebrew/Greek form is different due to a
//   variant, and perhaps there is an alternative Strongs number (and possibly
//   a different translation too.
//
// * FormAdjective : The word is an adjective, such as 'Divine'.
//
//
// Each of these records comprises:
//
// * recordType: Named, Mentioned, etc.
//
// * unifiedName: This always contains the unified name of the owning place.
//   Where an additional name is being associated with the place -- for
//   example, Iezer with Abiezer in the Group record for Iezrite -- that name
//   appears as a prefix, followed by a vertical bar: Iezer|Abiezer@Num.26.30-Jdg.
//
// * strongs: A list of Strongs information, each entry in the list being made
//   up as shown below.  The list form is needed because some names are made up
//   of more than one element, each of which has its own Strong's entry.
//
//   - dStrong (disambiguated Strong): A unique number for the given form of
//     the name.  This entry is in the form of a list, since in some case
//
//   - eStrong (extended Strong): Based on Strong, as extended by
//     OpenScripture to match the increased vocabulary in BDB. Where BDB
//     divided a Hebrew word into two or more words, this is indicated by
//     appending 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e' or 'f' to the eStrong value.
//
// * stepBibleLink: A URL which can be used to display in STEPBible the verse
//   where the name appears.  This may be truncated if the list of verses is
//   very extensive.
//
// * whereFound: A list of all the verse references where the this form of the
//   name is found.  Format is eg Gen.1.2 or Gen.1.2b.
//
//
//
// Summary record
// ==============
//
// The final record associated with each noun summarises the data which appears
// in the supplementary records.  It contains the following fields:
//
// * allNames: All the names by which the noun is known, in their common
//   English forms.
//
// * allDStrongs: All of the dStrongs values for the noun.
//
// * allRefs: All of the verse references in which the noun appears.
//
//
// Note that these field names are slightly misleading, in that the values
// may sometimes be truncated.  allRefs, in particular, may contain a
// truncated list, with words such as 'ch', 'etc' to indicate where elements
// have been omitted for the sake of brevity.
//
// Note that reference lists on the individual supplementary records are
// presented here in the form of a JSON list, with each reference spelled out
// in full.  The allRefs entry of the summary record, by contrast, is in string
// form and uses abbreviated forms where appropriate -- so that, for instance,
// rather than give 'Gen.1.1, Gen.1.2' it contains 'Gen.1.1, 2'.
//
//
//
// Empty / missing data
// ====================
//
// 'Empty' string fields contain a dash.

When the pit is opened, locusts with the power to torment people come out, led by the angel Abaddon or Apollyon. This angel is described as the king over the locusts, which are sent as a judgment upon the earth.

However, through Esther's intervention, the king issued a new decree allowing the Jews to defend themselves, which they did on the thirteenth day of Adar (Est.8:12; 9:1). The Jews celebrated their victory over their enemies on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of Adar, which became the feast of Purim (Est.9:17-19,21).

Some scholars propose that Alamoth could be related to the Hebrew word for \"young women,\" indicating that the term might refer to a women's choir or a high vocal range.

The prophecy in Jeremiah 46 foretells the punishment of Egypt and its gods, including Amon. ¶In Nahum 3:8, Amon is mentioned as a city, which is most likely a reference to Thebes, the ancient capital of Egypt. Thebes was known as \"No-Amon,\" meaning \"the city of Amon,\" due to the prominence of the god Amon in the city. Nahum compares the fate of Nineveh to that of Thebes, which had been conquered and destroyed despite its power and the protection of its god.",

Some scholars suggest that they may have been a group of Persian officials or governors stationed in the region.

According to Acts 19, her worship was widespread and economically significant in the city. Demetrius, a silversmith who crafted shrines of Artemis, stirred up opposition against Paul and his companions, fearing that the spread of Christianity would threaten his business and the goddess's reputation (Acts 19:24-27). ¶The Ephesians held Artemis in high regard, proclaiming her as \"great\" and believing that her image had fallen from heaven (Acts 19:27, 35). When Paul's preaching led to many Ephesians abandoning idol worship, Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen incited a riot in the city theater, chanting \"Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!\" for about two hours (Acts 19:28, 34). The city clerk eventually calmed the crowd, defending Paul and his companions and dismissing the assembly (Acts 19:35-41). ¶The worship of Artemis in Ephesus demonstrates the challenges faced by early Christians as they sought to spread the gospel in a culture deeply rooted in pagan religious practices. The account in Acts 19 highlights the social, economic, and spiritual implications of Paul's ministry and the transformative power of the gospel message.",

The Israelites were repeatedly warned against setting up Asherah poles or planting trees as idolatrous symbols near the altar of the Lord (Deuteronomy 16:21; Judges 6:25-30; 1 Kings 14:15, 16:33; 2 Kings 17:16). However, many Israelite kings and people disobeyed these commands and engaged in Asherah worship (1 Kings 15:13, 18:19; 2 Kings 13:6, 21:3, 7; 2 Chronicles 15:16, 24:18, 33:3). ¶Several kings, such as Asa, Hezekiah, and Josiah, sought to remove Asherah poles and images from the land as part of their religious reforms (2 Kings 18:4, 23:4-7, 14-15; 2 Chronicles 14:3, 17:6, 31:1, 34:3-4, 7). The prophets also condemned the worship of Asherah, associating it with idolatry and unfaithfulness to God (Isaiah 17:8, 27:9; Jeremiah 17:2; Micah 5:14). ¶The persistent presence of Asherah worship throughout Israel's history demonstrates the Israelites' struggle to remain faithful to the Lord and resist the influence of surrounding pagan cultures. The biblical accounts emphasize the importance of removing idolatrous symbols and practices and the need for ongoing spiritual reformation.",

This practice of worshipping foreign gods alongside or in place of the Lord was condemned by the biblical writers as a violation of the covenant relationship between God and His people.",

After the Philistines captured the ark of the covenant, they placed it in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod and later returned it with an offering of golden tumors and rats, which they sent to Beth-shemesh on a cart pulled by two cows (1 Sam 6:1-14). The name Ashtaroth is also used to refer to the place where her cult was practiced, such as Ashtaroth-karnaim, a city in Bashan (Gen 14:5; Deut 1:4; Josh 9:10; 12:4; 13:12, 31).",

On this day, two goats were selected, one for the Lord and the other for Azazel. The high priest would cast lots to determine which goat would be sacrificed to the Lord and which would be sent into the wilderness \"to Azazel\" (Leviticus 16:8, 10). ¶The goat designated for Azazel, often called the scapegoat, would have the sins of the Israelites confessed over it by the high priest. It would then be sent into the wilderness, symbolically carrying away the sins of the people (Leviticus 16:21-22). The person who led the goat into the wilderness was required to wash his clothes and bathe before returning to the camp (Leviticus 16:26). ¶The exact identity of Azazel is uncertain. Some scholars suggest that Azazel may refer to a demon or fallen angel, while others propose that it could be a geographical location or a term meaning \"complete removal.\" The scapegoat ritual involving Azazel emphasizes the complete removal and separation of sin from the people on the Day of Atonement.",

Abimelech, seeking to establish his rule over Shechem, received silver from the temple of Baal-berith to hire worthless and reckless men to support him (Judges 9:4). Later, when the people of Shechem rebelled against Abimelech, they put their trust in the temple of El-berith (Judges 9:46). ¶The worship of Baal-berith/El-berith by the Israelites demonstrates their recurring tendency to stray from the Lord and embrace the idolatrous practices of the surrounding Canaanite culture. This unfaithfulness to the covenant with the Lord led to various conflicts and consequences throughout the period of the judges. ¶The name Baal-berith/El-berith suggests that this deity was associated with the concept of a covenant or agreement, possibly related to treaties or alliances between cities or nations. However, the biblical account emphasizes that the true covenant relationship is between the Lord and His people, and any devotion to other gods is a violation of this covenant.",

    "shortDescription": "Baal, a Canaanite god of fertility and weather, and Peor, a Moabite god, were worshipped by the Israelites, leading them into idolatry and disobedience to the Lord.",
    "longDescription": "Baal, meaning \"lord\" or \"master,\" was a prominent Canaanite god associated with fertility, weather, and agriculture. The Israelites were repeatedly warned against worshipping Baal, as it was considered a violation of their covenant with the Lord (Judges 2:11, 13; 3:7; 10:6, 10; 1 Samuel 7:4; 12:10). However, many Israelites succumbed to Baal worship, often under the influence of foreign rulers or through intermarriage with Canaanites (Judges 8:33; 1 Kings 16:31-32; 22:53; 2 Kings 10:18-28; 17:16). ¶Several biblical accounts depict the conflict between Baal worship and devotion to the Lord. The prophet Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel, demonstrating the power and supremacy of the Lord (1 Kings 18:16-40). King Ahab and his wife Jezebel were notorious for promoting Baal worship in Israel (1 Kings 16:31-32; 21:25-26). Later, King Jehu carried out a purge of Baal worshippers in Israel (2 Kings 10:18-28). ¶The worship of Baal often involved the use of sacred pillars or poles, known as Asherah poles (Judges 6:25-32; 1 Kings 16:32-33; 2 Kings 21:3; 23:4-5). The prophets consistently condemned Baal worship, associating it with idolatry, child sacrifice, and spiritual unfaithfulness (Jeremiah 2:8, 23; 7:9; 11:13, 17; 19:5; 23:13, 27; 32:29, 35; Hosea 2:8, 13, 17; 11:2; 13:1; Zephaniah 1:4). ¶Peor, mentioned in connection with Baal (Numbers 25:3, 5; Psalm 106:28), was a Moabite god. The Israelites engaged in idolatry and sexual immorality with the Moabites at Baal-peor, resulting in a plague that killed 24,000 people (Numbers 25:1-9). This incident is cited as an example of the consequences of forsaking the Lord and embracing pagan worship (Deuteronomy 4:3; Hosea 9:10). ¶The recurring theme of Baal and Peor worship in the Bible serves as a warning against compromising one's faith and succumbing to the temptations of idolatry. It emphasizes the importance of remaining faithful to the Lord and rejecting the worship of false gods.",

The passage also mentions that only its Creator can approach it with a sword, suggesting that Behemoth is not easily overcome or controlled by humans (Job 40:19). ¶The exact identity of Behemoth is uncertain, and various interpretations have been proposed. Some scholars suggest that it may refer to a hippopotamus, elephant, or even a mythical creature. However, the primary purpose of the Behemoth in the book of Job is to illustrate God's power, wisdom, and sovereignty over His creation, rather than to provide a zoological description.",

This prophecy indicates the destruction of Babylon and the defeat of its gods. ¶Furthermore, in Jeremiah 51:44, the Lord declares that He will punish Bel in Babylon and make him spew out what he has swallowed. This imagery suggests that the Lord will force Bel to release the nations and peoples that Babylon had conquered and oppressed. ¶The biblical references to Bel serve to emphasize the supremacy of the Lord over the gods of the nations and to demonstrate the inevitable downfall of those who trust in false deities.

According to 1 Kings 7:15, each pillar was eighteen cubits high (approximately 27 feet or 8.2 meters) and twelve cubits in circumference (approximately 18 feet or 5.5 meters). The pillars were hollow, with a wall thickness of four fingers (about 3 inches or 7.6 centimeters). ¶On top of each pillar was a bronze capital, which was five cubits high (approximately 7.5 feet or 2.3 meters) and decorated with a network of pomegranates (1 Kings 7:16-20; 2 Chronicles 3:15-17). The pillars were set up at the entrance of the Temple's portico, with Jachin on the right and Boaz on the left (1 Kings 7:21; 2 Chronicles 3:17). ¶The names of the pillars, Jachin and Boaz, are believed to have symbolic meanings. Jachin means \"he establishes,\" while Boaz means \"in him is strength.\" Together, these names may represent the idea that the Temple and the worship of the Lord were established by God's strength and would endure. ¶The pillars Jachin and Boaz were not only architectural features but also served as reminders of God's presence and the stability and strength that He provides for His people.

During this time, the Israelites lived in temporary shelters or booths, relying on God's provision and guidance (Leviticus 23:42-43). ¶The festival is celebrated in the autumn, typically in September or October, and lasts for seven days. During this time, observant Jews construct temporary dwellings called sukkot (booths) and dwell in them for the duration of the festival. These booths are usually made of natural materials such as branches and leaves and are decorated with fruits and other harvest-related items. ¶In John 7, Jesus goes to Jerusalem during the Booths_Festival and teaches in the Temple courts (John 7:14). His presence and teachings at the festival cause division among the people, with some believing in Him and others seeking to arrest Him (John 7:25-44). ¶The Booths_Festival is a time of rejoicing and thanksgiving, commemorating God's provision and care for His people during their wilderness wanderings.

    "longDescription": "Chemosh was the national god of the Moabites, a neighboring people to the Israelites. He is mentioned several times in the Old Testament, often in the context of idolatry and the Israelites' unfaithfulness to the Lord. ¶In Numbers 21:29, Chemosh is referred to as the god of the Moabites, to whom they attributed their victories and defeats. Judges 11:24 mentions Chemosh as the god who gave the Moabites their land, drawing a parallel between him and the Lord, who gave the Israelites their land. ¶King Solomon, despite his wisdom, turned away from the Lord and built a high place for Chemosh on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem (1 Kings 11:7, 33). This act of idolatry was one of the reasons for the division of Solomon's kingdom after his death. ¶The worship of Chemosh persisted among the Israelites, and King Josiah, as part of his religious reforms, destroyed the high places dedicated to Chemosh (2 Kings 23:13). The prophet Jeremiah also denounced the worship of Chemosh, foretelling the destruction of Moab and the shame that would come upon those who trusted in this false god (Jeremiah 48:7, 13, 46). ¶The biblical references to Chemosh serve as a warning against the dangers of idolatry and the consequences of turning away from the Lord to worship other gods. They also highlight the importance of remaining faithful to the one true God and resisting the temptation to conform to the religious practices of the surrounding nations.",

This month corresponds to the modern months of November-December. ¶In Nehemiah 1:1, the month of Chislev is associated with the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes' reign. It was during this month that Nehemiah, who was serving as the king's cupbearer in Susa, received news about the distress of the Jews who had returned to Jerusalem and the poor condition of the city's walls. This news prompted Nehemiah to pray and seek permission from the king to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the city (Nehemiah 1:2-11). ¶Zechariah 7:1 mentions that the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah in the fourth year of King Darius' reign, on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. This oracle was given in response to a question about fasting and mourning posed by the people of Bethel (Zechariah 7:2-3). ¶The month of Chislev falls during the rainy season in Israel and is associated with the winter solstice. In later Jewish tradition, the festival of Hanukkah, which commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple after the Maccabean Revolt, is celebrated in the month of Chislev. ¶The biblical references to Chislev provide insight into the ancient Hebrew calendar and the religious and historical events that took place during this month. They also demonstrate the importance of seeking God's guidance and the role of prayer and fasting in the lives of believers.",

These records were likely maintained by official scribes or court historians and served as a source of information for the authors of the biblical books of Kings and Chronicles. ¶The Chronicles are referred to in the context of the reigns of various kings, such as Jeroboam (1 Kings 14:19), Rehoboam (1 Kings 14:29), Abijam (1 Kings 15:7), Asa (1 Kings 15:23), Nadab (1 Kings 15:31), Baasha (1 Kings 16:5), Elah (1 Kings 16:14), Zimri (1 Kings 16:20), Omri (1 Kings 16:27), Ahab (1 Kings 22:39), Jehoshaphat (1 Kings 22:45), Joram (2 Kings 8:23), Jehu (2 Kings 10:34), Joash (2 Kings 12:19), Jehoahaz (2 Kings 13:8), Jehoash (2 Kings 13:12), Jeroboam II (2 Kings 14:28), Azariah (2 Kings 15:6), Zechariah (2 Kings 15:11), Shallum (2 Kings 15:15), Menahem (2 Kings 15:21), Pekahiah (2 Kings 15:26), Pekah (2 Kings 15:31), Jotham (2 Kings 15:36), Ahaz (2 Kings 16:19), Hezekiah (2 Kings 20:20), Manasseh (2 Kings 21:17), Amon (2 Kings 21:25), Josiah (2 Kings 23:28), and Jehoiakim (2 Kings 24:5). ¶These references typically state that the rest of the acts of a particular king, along with details about his reign, are written in the Chronicles. This suggests that the Chronicles contained more extensive information about each king's life, accomplishments, and failures than what is recorded in the biblical narrative. ¶The Chronicles are also mentioned in the books of Chronicles themselves (1 Chronicles 29:29; 2 Chronicles 33:18-19), as well as in the book of Nehemiah (Nehemiah 12:23) and Esther (Esther 10:2). These references further emphasize the importance of the Chronicles as historical records and sources of information for the biblical authors.",

The Philistines saw this as their god submitting to the God of Israel. Later, Samson was brought into the temple of Dagon in Gaza, where the Philistines praised Dagon for delivering Samson into their hands. However, Samson prayed for strength and pushed apart the pillars of the temple, collapsing it and killing himself and the Philistines inside (Judges 16:23-30).

    "longDescription": "The Dedication_Festival, mentioned in John 10:22, is a Jewish festival also known as Hanukkah or the Festival of Lights. This festival commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem during the second century BC, after it had been desecrated by the Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes. ¶According to Jewish tradition, when the Maccabees recaptured and cleansed the Temple, they found only enough pure olive oil to light the Temple menorah for one day. However, the oil miraculously lasted for eight days, allowing time for new, pure oil to be prepared. Hanukkah celebrates this miracle and the triumph of the Maccabees over their oppressors. ¶The Dedication_Festival is observed for eight days, typically in December, and is characterized by the lighting of the menorah, special prayers, and the singing of hymns. The festival also involves the eating of fried foods, such as potato pancakes (latkes) and doughnuts (sufganiyot), which are prepared in oil to commemorate the miracle of the Temple oil. ¶In John 10:22-23, Jesus is mentioned as being in Jerusalem during the Dedication_Festival and walking in Solomon's Colonnade in the Temple. This setting provides the context for His discourse on His identity as the Good Shepherd and His unity with the Father (John 10:24-39). ¶The Dedication_Festival serves as a reminder of God's faithfulness and the importance of preserving and rededicating oneself to the worship and service of the Lord, even in the face of opposition and persecution.",

By setting a table and filling cups for Destiny, the Israelites were essentially seeking the favor and protection of this false god, rather than trusting in the Lord. ¶The mention of Destiny in Isaiah 65:11 highlights the Israelites' persistent struggle with idolatry and their tendency to adopt the religious practices of the surrounding pagan cultures.

    "longDescription": "Elul is the name of the sixth month in the ancient Hebrew calendar, as mentioned in Nehemiah 6:15. This month corresponds to the modern months of August-September. ¶In the biblical account, the month of Elul is associated with the completion of the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem under the leadership of Nehemiah. Nehemiah 6:15 states that the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of Elul, after just fifty-two days of work. This rapid completion of the wall, despite opposition and threats from enemies, was attributed to the help and protection of God (Nehemiah 6:16). ¶The month of Elul holds special significance in Jewish tradition. It is considered a time of preparation for the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah (the Jewish New Year) and Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), which occur in the following month of Tishri. During Elul, Jews engage in self-reflection, repentance, and spiritual renewal in anticipation of these solemn days. ¶The name \"Elul\" is believed to be of Babylonian origin, likely adopted by the Jews during the Babylonian exile. In later Jewish tradition, the letters of the name \"Elul\" are interpreted as an acronym for the phrase \"Ani L'dodi V'dodi Li,\" which means \"I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine,\" a reference to the love between God and His people. ¶The biblical reference to Elul in the context of the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem highlights the importance of diligence, perseverance, and reliance on God's strength in the face of challenges and opposition. It also underscores the significance of this month as a time of spiritual preparation and renewal.",

    "longDescription": "Epicureans were followers of the philosophical school founded by Epicurus, a Greek philosopher who lived from 341 to 270 BC. The Epicurean school of thought is briefly mentioned in the New Testament, specifically in Acts 17:18, where Paul encounters Epicurean and Stoic philosophers in Athens. ¶The central tenet of Epicureanism was the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. However, Epicurus did not advocate for hedonism or the indulgence of all desires. Instead, he taught that true happiness could be attained through the cultivation of simple pleasures, such as friendship, contentment, and peace of mind. Epicureans believed that the absence of pain and the presence of tranquility were the highest forms of pleasure. ¶In terms of religion, Epicureans held that the gods existed but were distant and uninvolved in human affairs. They rejected the idea of divine intervention and the fear of divine punishment. Epicureans also believed that the universe was composed of atoms and that everything happened by chance, without any divine purpose or design. ¶When Paul encountered the Epicurean philosophers in Athens, he used their own beliefs as a starting point for his preaching of the gospel. He acknowledged their religious devotion but challenged their understanding of the divine, proclaiming the one true God who created the world and calls all people to repentance and faith in Jesus Christ (Acts 17:22-31). ¶The mention of Epicureans in the Bible provides insight into the intellectual and philosophical climate of the ancient Greek world and the challenges faced by early Christian missionaries as they sought to proclaim the gospel in a context of diverse beliefs and worldviews.",

According to Greek mythology, Hermes was the son of Zeus and the messenger of the gods, associated with eloquence, diplomacy, and commerce. ¶In the context of Acts 14, Paul and Barnabas were preaching in the city of Lystra, where they healed a man who had been lame from birth (Acts 14:8-10). The people of Lystra, witnessing this miracle, believed that the gods had come down to them in human form. They identified Barnabas as Zeus, the chief god in the Greek pantheon, and Paul as Hermes, because he was the chief speaker (Acts 14:11-12). ¶This incident highlights the challenge faced by early Christian missionaries as they proclaimed the gospel in a culture steeped in polytheistic beliefs. The people of Lystra, unfamiliar with the concept of the one true God, attempted to interpret the miracle and the message of Paul and Barnabas through the lens of their own religious understanding. ¶Paul and Barnabas, however, quickly rejected the people's attempt to worship them as gods, tearing their clothes and urging the crowd to turn from worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth (Acts 14:14-18). This event underscores the importance of clear communication and contextualization when presenting the gospel message to those from different cultural and religious backgrounds.",

    "longDescription": "The Herodians were a Jewish political party that supported the rule of the Herodian dynasty, which governed Judea and the surrounding regions under the authority of the Roman Empire. They are mentioned in the New Testament on three occasions, always in connection with the Pharisees and their opposition to Jesus (Matthew 22:16; Mark 3:6; 12:13). ¶The Herodians' political allegiance to the Herodian family put them at odds with the Pharisees, who resented the Roman occupation and the Herodian dynasty's collaboration with the Romans. However, despite their differences, the Herodians and the Pharisees found common ground in their opposition to Jesus and His teachings. ¶In Matthew 22:16 and Mark 12:13, the Herodians and the Pharisees together sought to entrap Jesus with a question about paying taxes to Caesar. This question was designed to force Jesus into taking a position that would either alienate Him from the people or provide grounds for accusing Him of sedition against the Roman authorities. Jesus, however, perceived their hypocrisy and answered with wisdom, saying, \"Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's\" (Mark 12:17). ¶In Mark 3:6, following Jesus' healing of a man with a withered hand on the Sabbath, the Pharisees and the Herodians conspired together about how they might destroy Jesus. This collaboration between two groups with differing political views highlights the perceived threat that Jesus' ministry posed to the religious and political establishment of His day. ¶The Herodians' involvement in the opposition to Jesus reveals the complex political and religious landscape of first-century Judea and underscores the challenges Jesus faced as He proclaimed the coming of the Kingdom of God.",

Its exact meaning is uncertain, and various interpretations have been proposed by scholars. ¶Some suggest that Higgaion is a musical term, possibly indicating an interlude or a pause in the singing of the Psalm. This interpretation is supported by the fact that Higgaion is used in conjunction with the word \"Selah,\" another musical term found frequently in the Psalms (Psalm 9:16). ¶Others propose that Higgaion may be a literary device, signifying a pause for meditation, reflection, or contemplation. This understanding is based on the root of the word Higgaion, which is related to the Hebrew verb \"hagah,\" meaning \"to meditate\" or \"to muse.\" ¶In the context of Psalm 9, the use of Higgaion follows a declaration of God's judgment upon the wicked and the nations (Psalm 9:15-16). The presence of Higgaion at this point in the Psalm may invite the reader or listener to pause and reflect on the significance of God's righteous judgment and the ultimate fate of those who oppose Him. ¶While the precise meaning of Higgaion remains uncertain, its inclusion in the inspired text of Scripture points to the importance of pausing to meditate on the truths revealed in God's Word and the significance of His actions in human history.",

    "longDescription": "Hosanna appears in the New Testament exclusively during Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem.

They also proclaimed \"Hosanna in the highest\" (Mark 11:10), giving the acclamation a heavenly dimension. ¶ Children in the temple continued shouting \"Hosanna to the Son of David\" (Matthew 21:15), much to the displeasure of the chief priests and scribes. The crowd's use of palm branches while shouting \"Hosanna\" (John 12:13) connected this event with traditional Jewish celebrations. ¶ In each gospel account, the Hosanna acclamation is closely tied to recognition of Jesus as the messianic king, the one \"who comes in the name of the Lord.\" The exclamation appears to have shifted from its original meaning as a plea for salvation to become an expression of praise and royal welcome. ¶ Probably derived from Hebrew \"hoshia-na\" found in Psalm 118:25, which was part of the Hallel sung at major Jewish festivals.",

These pillars were constructed by Hiram, a skilled craftsman from Tyre, who was commissioned by King Solomon to work on the Temple (1 Kings 7:13-14). ¶The pillars were made of bronze and were of significant size. According to 1 Kings 7:15, each pillar was eighteen cubits high (approximately 27 feet or 8.2 meters) and twelve cubits in circumference (approximately 18 feet or 5.5 meters). The pillars were hollow, with a wall thickness of four fingers (about 3 inches or 7.6 centimeters). ¶On top of each pillar was a bronze capital, which was five cubits high (approximately 7.5 feet or 2.3 meters) and decorated with a network of pomegranates (1 Kings 7:16-20; 2 Chronicles 3:15-17). The pillars were set up at the entrance of the Temple's portico, with Jachin on the right and Boaz on the left (1 Kings 7:21; 2 Chronicles 3:17). ¶The names of the pillars, Jachin and Boaz, are believed to have symbolic meanings. Jachin means \"he establishes,\" while Boaz means \"in him is strength.\" Together, these names may represent the idea that the Temple and the worship of the Lord were established by God's strength and would endure. ¶The pillars Jachin and Boaz were not only architectural features but also served as reminders of God's presence and the stability and strength that He provides for His people. They stood as symbols of the Temple's significance as the dwelling place of the Lord among the Israelites.",

In the New Testament, Judaism is mentioned specifically in Galatians 1:13-14, where Paul discusses his former way of life as a devout Jew. ¶Before his conversion to Christianity, Paul (then known as Saul) was a zealous adherent of Judaism. He describes his previous life in Judaism as one in which he intensely persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it (Galatians 1:13). This persecution was driven by his commitment to the traditions of his ancestors and his belief that the early Christian movement was a threat to the Jewish faith. ¶Paul further emphasizes his dedication to Judaism by stating that he was advancing in Judaism beyond many of his contemporaries among his people, being extremely zealous for the traditions of his fathers (Galatians 1:14). This suggests that Paul was not only a devout Jew but also a scholar and a leader in the Jewish community. ¶However, after his encounter with the risen Christ on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:1-19), Paul underwent a dramatic conversion and became a follower of Jesus. He came to understand that salvation is not achieved through adherence to the law but through faith in Christ (Galatians 2:16; 3:11-14). ¶Paul's mention of his former life in Judaism serves to highlight the transformative power of the gospel and the grace of God in his life. It also underscores the significant shift in his understanding of the relationship between the Jewish faith and the new covenant established through Jesus Christ.",

    "longDescription": "Legion is the name given to a demon or group of demons mentioned in the accounts of Jesus' ministry in the region of the Gerasenes, as recorded in Mark 5:1-20 and Luke 8:26-39. ¶In both accounts, Jesus encounters a man who is possessed by demons. When Jesus asks the demon its name, the response is \"Legion,\" for many demons had entered the man (Mark 5:9; Luke 8:30). The name \"Legion\" is derived from the Roman military term for a unit of 5,000 to 6,000 soldiers, emphasizing the large number of demons possessing the man. ¶The demon-possessed man is described as living among the tombs, crying out, and cutting himself with stones. He had extraordinary strength, breaking chains and shackles used to restrain him. The demons begged Jesus not to send them out of the area and requested to enter a nearby herd of pigs. Jesus granted their request, and the demons entered the pigs, causing the herd to rush down a steep bank into the sea and drown. ¶The use of the name \"Legion\" highlights the severity of the man's possession and the immense power and control the demons had over him. It also demonstrates Jesus' authority over the spiritual realm, as He commanded the demons to leave the man, and they obeyed. ¶The deliverance of the demon-possessed man served as a powerful testimony to the surrounding region. The man, now clothed and in his right mind, began to proclaim what Jesus had done for him, spreading the message of Jesus' power and compassion. ¶The account of Legion emphasizes Jesus' power over evil spirits and His ability to bring healing and restoration to those oppressed by demonic forces. It also foreshadows Jesus' ultimate victory over Satan and the forces of darkness through His death and resurrection.",

    "longDescription": "Leviathan is a large sea creature mentioned in various contexts throughout the Old Testament. The Hebrew word \"leviathan\" is derived from a root meaning \"to twist\" or \"to coil,\" suggesting a serpentine or dragon-like creature. ¶In Job 3:8, Leviathan is mentioned in the context of Job's lament, where he curses the day of his birth and invokes those who are skilled in rousing Leviathan to curse it as well. This passage suggests that Leviathan was associated with chaos or evil. ¶Job 41:1-34 provides the most detailed description of Leviathan, portraying it as a powerful and fearsome creature with impenetrable scales, terrible teeth, and the ability to breathe fire. In this context, Leviathan is used as an illustration of God's power over creation and His ability to subdue even the mightiest of creatures. ¶In Psalm 74:14, Leviathan is depicted as having multiple heads, which God crushed and gave as food to the creatures of the wilderness. This imagery is likely symbolic, representing God's victory over the forces of chaos and evil. ¶Psalm 104:26 mentions Leviathan as one of the sea creatures that God formed to play in the vast waters, showcasing God's creative power and the diversity of His creation. ¶Isaiah 27:1 prophesies that on the day of the Lord's judgment, He will punish Leviathan, described as the fleeing and twisting serpent, with His fierce and mighty sword. This passage portrays Leviathan as a symbol of evil or chaos that will ultimately be defeated by God. ¶The exact identity of Leviathan is uncertain, with some scholars suggesting it may refer to a crocodile, a whale, or a mythological sea monster. However, the biblical references to Leviathan are primarily symbolic, representing chaos, evil, or the forces opposed to God. The passages emphasize God's sovereignty over creation and His ultimate victory over all that challenges His rule.",

Isaiah depicts the king as having an inflated ego, thinking himself to be above the stars of God, but he will be brought low and cast down to the realm of the dead (Isaiah 14:13-15). The Latin Vulgate later translated \"Helel\" as \"Lucifer\" which was then carried over into the King James Version. But the passage is not about Satan's fall, rather it is using poetic language to portray the judgment coming upon the proud king of Babylon.",

The exact meaning of the term is uncertain, and scholars have proposed various interpretations. ¶Some suggest that Mahalath may refer to a musical instrument, possibly a type of flute or stringed instrument. Others propose that it could indicate a specific tune or melody to which these psalms were to be sung. ¶Another interpretation is that Mahalath might be a literary term, possibly denoting a particular style of composition or a type of contemplative or mournful song. This view is supported by the content of the psalms in which Mahalath appears, as both Psalm 53 and Psalm 88 deal with themes of human sinfulness, despair, and the need for God's intervention. ¶In Psalm 53, which is nearly identical to Psalm 14, the psalmist laments the widespread corruption of humanity and the apparent absence of those who seek God. The psalm concludes with a prayer for God's salvation and the restoration of His people. ¶Psalm 88, one of the darkest and most somber psalms in the Psalter, is a cry of deep anguish and despair. The psalmist feels overwhelmed by God's wrath and abandoned by friends and family. The psalm ends without a clear resolution, emphasizing the depth of the psalmist's suffering. ¶While the precise meaning of Mahalath remains uncertain, its presence in the superscriptions of these psalms highlights the importance of music and literary expression in the worship and prayers of ancient Israel. It also serves as a reminder of the raw honesty and emotional depth found in the Psalms, as they give voice to the full range of human experience and the longing for God's presence and deliverance.",

    "shortDescription": "Maranatha is an Aramaic expression that means \"Our Lord, come!\" and is used in 1 Corinthians 16:22 as a prayer for the Lord's return.",
    "longDescription": "Maranatha is an Aramaic expression that appears in the New Testament, specifically in 1 Corinthians 16:22. The word consists of two Aramaic components: \"Marana\" meaning \"our Lord,\" and \"tha\" meaning \"come.\" Together, the phrase \"Maranatha\" can be translated as \"Our Lord, come!\" or \"Come, O Lord!\" ¶In the context of 1 Corinthians 16, the Apostle Paul is concluding his letter to the Corinthian church with a series of exhortations and greetings. He writes, \"If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come!\" (1 Corinthians 16:22, ESV). The placement of \"Maranatha\" at the end of this verse emphasizes the urgency and longing for the Lord's return. ¶The use of an Aramaic expression in a predominantly Greek-speaking context suggests that \"Maranatha\" may have been a common prayer or liturgical formula in the early Christian church. It encapsulates the belief in the second coming of Christ and the eager anticipation of His return to establish His kingdom on earth. ¶The prayer \"Maranatha\" reflects the early church's hope and longing for the fulfillment of God's promises and the consummation of His redemptive plan. It expresses the desire for Christ's return, judgment of evil, and the establishment of His eternal reign. ¶The inclusion of \"Maranatha\" in Paul's letter to the Corinthians also serves as a reminder to the church to remain faithful, watchful, and ready for the Lord's coming. It encourages believers to live in light of eternity and to maintain a sense of urgency in their spiritual lives. ¶Beyond its use in 1 Corinthians 16:22, the prayer \"Maranatha\" has been adopted by the broader Christian tradition as a declaration of faith, hope, and longing for Christ's return. It continues to be used in liturgical settings and personal prayers, expressing the ongoing desire of believers for the fulfillment of God's kingdom on earth.",

The precise meaning of the term is uncertain, and various interpretations have been proposed by scholars. ¶One common understanding is that Maskil refers to a contemplative or instructive psalm. The root of the word Maskil is related to the Hebrew verb \"sakal,\" which means \"to be prudent\" or \"to have insight.\" This suggests that the psalms labeled as Maskil may have been intended to impart wisdom, understanding, or instruction to the listener or reader. ¶Another interpretation is that Maskil could indicate a specific musical style or genre. Some scholars propose that it may refer to a skillfully composed song or a psalm that requires musical expertise to perform. The Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament, often translates Maskil as \"a psalm of understanding\" or \"a skillful psalm.\" ¶The psalms designated as Maskil cover a range of themes and emotions, from penitence and lament to praise and thanksgiving. For example, Psalm 32 is a penitential psalm that reflects on the joy of forgiveness, while Psalm 45 is a royal wedding song that celebrates the king's marriage and God's blessing upon the monarchy. ¶Several Maskil psalms, such as Psalms 42, 44, and 88, are psalms of lament, expressing deep sorrow, despair, or feelings of abandonment by God. Others, like Psalms 52 and 78, offer wisdom and instruction, warning against wickedness and urging trust in God. ¶The use of the term Maskil in the superscriptions of these psalms highlights the importance of musical and literary expression in ancient Israelite worship. It also underscores the role of the Psalms in providing guidance, comfort, and instruction to God's people as they navigate the complexities of life and faith. ¶While the exact meaning of Maskil remains uncertain, its presence in the Psalter testifies to the rich tradition of musical and poetic composition in ancient Israel and the enduring power of the Psalms to speak to the human experience across generations.",

God asks, \"Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season, or can you guide the Bear with its children?\" (Job 38:32, ESV). The parallelism in this verse suggests that Mazzaroth is related to astronomical bodies or constellations. ¶One common interpretation is that Mazzaroth refers to the twelve constellations of the zodiac. The word Mazzaroth may be derived from the Akkadian term \"manzaztu,\" which means \"station\" or \"position,\" possibly referring to the positions of the stars and planets in the night sky. ¶Another view is that Mazzaroth could be a reference to the planets or the general arrangement of the heavenly bodies. Some scholars have suggested that it may be related to the Hebrew word \"mazzalot,\" which appears in 2 Kings 23:5 and is often translated as \"constellations.\" ¶The mention of Mazzaroth in the context of God's questioning of Job underscores the limitless wisdom and power of God as the Creator and Sustainer of the universe.",

In John 1:41, Andrew tells his brother Simon Peter, \"We have found the Messiah\" (which means Christ). In John 4:25, the Samaritan woman at the well says to Jesus, \"I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ).\" ¶The Greek equivalent of \"Messiah\" is \"Christos,\" from which the title \"Christ\" is derived.

    "longDescription": "Miktam is a term that appears in the titles of six Psalms: 16, 56-60. Its exact meaning is uncertain, and various interpretations have been proposed. Some scholars suggest that it may be a musical or liturgical term, possibly related to the word \"miktab,\" which means \"writing\" or \"inscription.\" ¶Others propose that Miktam could be derived from the root \"katam,\" meaning \"to cover,\" and might refer to a \"covering\" or \"atonement\" psalm. Another theory is that it could be related to the Akkadian word \"katamu,\" meaning \"to hide\" or \"to keep secret,\" suggesting that these psalms contain hidden or mystical teachings. ¶Despite the lack of certainty about its precise meaning, the presence of Miktam in these Psalm titles indicates that it held some significance for the ancient Israelites in their worship and understanding of these particular psalms. The Miktam Psalms cover various themes, including trust in God, deliverance from enemies, and the experience of God's presence and protection.",

King Solomon built a high place for Molech on the Mount of Olives (1 Ki. 11:7), which was later destroyed by King Josiah during his religious reforms (2 Ki. 23:13). ¶The prophet Jeremiah condemns the practice of child sacrifice to Molech in the Valley of Hinnom near Jerusalem (Jer. 32:35). Molech is also mentioned in Amos 5:26 and Acts 7:43, where it is associated with idolatry and the worship of heavenly bodies. The name Molech is believed to derive from the Hebrew word \"melek,\" meaning \"king,\" and may have been a title rather than a proper name.",

If a Nazirite accidentally came into contact with a corpse, they had to undergo a purification ritual and restart their vow (Numbers 6:9-12). At the conclusion of the vow, the Nazirite would offer sacrifices, shave their consecrated hair, and burn it on the altar (Numbers 6:13-21). Samson, one of the judges of Israel, was a lifelong Nazirite from birth (Judges 13:5,7; 16:17).

    "longDescription": "Nebo is the name of a Babylonian deity mentioned in Isaiah 46:1, as well as a mountain in Moab where Moses viewed the Promised Land before his death (Deuteronomy 32:49; 34:1). ¶In the Babylonian pantheon, Nebo was the god of wisdom, writing, and prophecy. He was the son of Marduk, the chief god of Babylon, and his worship was centered in the ancient city of Borsippa. The name \"Nebo\" appears as an element in the names of several prominent Babylonian kings, indicating his importance in their religious and cultural life. ¶The biblical reference to Nebo in Isaiah 46:1 occurs in the context of a prophecy against Babylon, where the gods Bel and Nebo are depicted as being humiliated and carried away into captivity. This passage emphasizes the futility of trusting in false gods and the superiority of the Lord, the God of Israel. ¶Mount Nebo, located in Moab, is the place where Moses was granted a view of the Promised Land before his death (Deuteronomy 32:49; 34:1). The mountain is part of the Abarim range and is situated near the northeastern end of the Dead Sea. From its summit, one can see the Jordan Valley, the Dead Sea, and the hills of Jerusalem on a clear day. ¶According to the biblical account, Moses ascended Mount Nebo at the end of his life, and the Lord showed him the land that He had promised to give to the Israelites (Deuteronomy 34:1-4). After viewing the land, Moses died on the mountain, and God buried him in an unknown location in the valley (Deuteronomy 34:5-6). ¶The name \"Nebo\" also appears in the Bible as a town in Moab (Numbers 32:3, 38) and as a personal name (Ezra 2:29; 10:43; Nehemiah 7:33).",

    "longDescription": "Nehushtan was the name given to the bronze serpent that Moses made in the wilderness during the Israelites' journey from Egypt to the Promised Land (Numbers 21:8-9). The name \"Nehushtan\" is derived from the Hebrew word for bronze or copper, \"nehoshet.\" ¶According to the biblical account in Numbers 21, the Israelites spoke against God and Moses, complaining about the lack of food and water in the wilderness. As a result, the Lord sent venomous snakes among the people, causing many to die. When the people repented and asked Moses to intercede on their behalf, God instructed Moses to make a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. Anyone who had been bitten by a snake could look at the bronze serpent and live (Numbers 21:4-9). ¶The bronze serpent became a symbol of God's healing power and deliverance from the consequences of sin. However, by the time of King Hezekiah, who reigned over Judah from approximately 715 to 686 BC, the Israelites had begun to worship the bronze serpent as an idol. In 2 Kings 18:4, we learn that Hezekiah \"removed the high places and broke the pillars and cut down the Asherah. And he broke in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made, for until those days the people of Israel had made offerings to it (it was called Nehushtan).\" ¶Hezekiah's actions demonstrate his commitment to religious reform and his desire to purge the land of idolatry. By destroying the bronze serpent, which had become an object of misplaced worship, Hezekiah emphasized the importance of worshipping the Lord alone and not relying on physical objects or symbols for spiritual deliverance. ¶The story of Nehushtan serves as a reminder that even objects originally intended for good purposes can become idols if people place their trust and devotion in them instead of in God. It also highlights the need for periodic religious reform and the importance of maintaining proper worship practices.",

    "longDescription": "Nergal was a Mesopotamian deity mentioned in 2 Kings 17:30 as one of the gods worshipped by the people of Cuth, who were among the foreign settlers brought to Samaria by the Assyrians after the deportation of the Israelites. ¶In Mesopotamian mythology, Nergal was associated with war, pestilence, and the underworld. He was often depicted as a lion-headed deity holding a sword and a mace. Nergal was the patron god of the city of Cuthah (or Kutha) in Babylonia, which explains why the Cuthites brought his worship with them when they were resettled in Samaria. ¶The biblical context of 2 Kings 17 describes the religious syncretism that occurred in Samaria after the Assyrian conquest and the resettlement of various foreign peoples in the region. These foreign settlers continued to worship their own gods, including Nergal, alongside the worship of the Lord (2 Kings 17:29-33). ¶The worship of Nergal and other foreign deities in Samaria was seen as a violation of the covenant between God and Israel, which required exclusive devotion to the Lord. The prophets consistently condemned the worship of foreign gods and called for repentance and a return to faithful worship of the Lord alone. ¶The mention of Nergal in the Bible serves as an example of the religious challenges faced by the Israelites living in a region surrounded by polytheistic cultures. It also highlights the importance of remaining faithful to the Lord and resisting the temptation to adopt the religious practices of neighboring nations.",

    "longDescription": "The New Moon was a significant religious observance in ancient Israel, marking the beginning of each month in the Hebrew lunar calendar. It was a time for special sacrifices, feasts, and rest from work. ¶In the Old Testament, the New Moon is mentioned alongside Sabbaths and other appointed feasts as days of worship and celebration (e.g., Numbers 10:10; 28:11-15; 1 Chronicles 23:31; 2 Chronicles 2:4; Ezra 3:5; Nehemiah 10:33; Isaiah 1:13-14; Ezekiel 45:17; Hosea 2:11). The New Moon was determined by the appearance of the first sliver of the new lunar crescent, which marked the beginning of a new month. ¶The New Moon observances often included the offering of special sacrifices, such as burnt offerings and sin offerings (Numbers 28:11-15). It was also a time for gathering together, feasting, and blowing trumpets (Numbers 10:10; Psalm 81:3). ¶In the New Testament, the New Moon is mentioned in Colossians 2:16, where Paul instructs believers not to let anyone judge them regarding food, drink, or in respect to a festival, a New Moon, or Sabbaths. This passage suggests that some early Christians, particularly those from a Jewish background, may have continued to observe the New Moon and other Jewish religious practices. ¶However, Paul emphasizes that these observances are a shadow of the things to come, and that the substance belongs to Christ (Colossians 2:17). He teaches that believers are no longer bound by these religious regulations.",

    "longDescription": "The Nicolaitans were a group mentioned twice in the Book of Revelation (2:6, 15) as a sect whose practices were strongly condemned by Jesus. In His messages to the seven churches, Jesus commends the church in Ephesus for hating the practices of the Nicolaitans (Revelation 2:6) and warns the church in Pergamum against those who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans (Revelation 2:15). ¶Although the exact nature of the Nicolaitans' practices and teachings is not explicitly described in the Bible, it is evident that they were considered heretical and contrary to the true gospel. Some early church fathers, such as Irenaeus and Hippolytus, associated the Nicolaitans with Nicolaus, one of the seven deacons mentioned in Acts 6:5, suggesting that he had departed from the faith and became the founder of this sect. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support this claim. ¶Other interpretations propose that the Nicolaitans may have promoted a form of antinomianism, which is the belief that moral law is not binding on Christians, or that they may have encouraged compromise with pagan practices and idolatry. These interpretations are based on the context of the warnings against the Nicolaitans in Revelation, which are connected to the warnings against sexual immorality and eating food sacrificed to idols (Revelation 2:14, 20). ¶Regardless of the specific nature of their teachings, it is clear that the practices of the Nicolaitans were seen as a serious threat to the purity and faithfulness of the early church. Jesus' strong condemnation of the Nicolaitans serves as a warning to all believers to remain vigilant against false teachings and practices that could lead them away from the truth of the gospel.",

    "longDescription": "Nisroch is the name of an Assyrian deity mentioned in the Bible in connection with the death of King Sennacherib of Assyria. According to 2 Kings 19:37 and Isaiah 37:38, Sennacherib was worshipping in the temple of Nisroch when he was assassinated by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer, who then fled to the land of Ararat. ¶The exact identity of Nisroch is uncertain, as this name does not appear in any known Assyrian or Babylonian texts or inscriptions. Some scholars suggest that Nisroch may be a corruption or a variant spelling of the name of a known Assyrian deity, such as Nusku, the god of fire and light, or Ninurta, the god of hunting and war. ¶Another theory proposes that Nisroch might have been a deity associated with agriculture or vegetation, based on a possible etymological connection with the Hebrew word \"neser,\" which means \"branch\" or \"shoot.\" However, this theory lacks substantial evidence. ¶The biblical account of Sennacherib's death in the temple of Nisroch is consistent with ancient Near Eastern practices, where kings often worshipped and made offerings in the temples of their gods. The assassination of Sennacherib by his own sons while worshipping in the temple may also be seen as an act of divine judgment, as Sennacherib had previously blasphemed against the Lord and threatened Jerusalem (2 Kings 18-19; Isaiah 36-37). ¶Although the specific identity of Nisroch remains a mystery, the mention of this deity in the Bible provides insight into the religious practices of the Assyrian kings and the historical context of Sennacherib's reign and demise.",

    "longDescription": "Orion is a well-known constellation mentioned in three passages in the Old Testament: Job 9:9, Job 38:31, and Amos 5:8. In each of these references, Orion is used to illustrate God's power, wisdom, and sovereignty over creation. ¶In Job 9:9, Orion is listed along with other constellations, such as the Bear, Pleiades, and the chambers of the south, as an example of God's handiwork in the heavens. This passage emphasizes God's omnipotence and the vastness of His creation, which is beyond human understanding. ¶In Job 38:31, God challenges Job by asking, \"Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion?\" This rhetorical question highlights God's control over the constellations and the laws that govern the universe. It also serves to remind Job of his limited understanding and power compared to the infinite wisdom and might of God. ¶In Amos 5:8, the prophet declares that God \"made the Pleiades and Orion,\" using these constellations as examples of God's creative power. This passage is set in the context of a call to repentance and a warning of impending judgment, reminding the people of Israel that the God who created the stars is also the One who will hold them accountable for their actions. ¶The mention of Orion in these biblical passages serves to emphasize the majesty, power, and wisdom of God as displayed in His creation. The constellations, including Orion, are seen as evidence of God's handiwork and His sovereign control over the universe. These references also serve to humble humanity, reminding us of our limited understanding and the need to submit to the Creator of all things.",

    "longDescription": "Passover is one of the major Jewish festivals, instituted by God to commemorate the Israelites' deliverance from slavery in Egypt. It is observed annually on the 14th day of the first month, Nisan (Exodus 12:11; Leviticus 23:5; Numbers 28:16). ¶ The festival's name derives from the event in which the Lord \"passed over\" the houses of the Israelites during the tenth plague, sparing their firstborn while striking down those of the Egyptians (Exodus 12:27). This night marked the beginning of the Exodus, the foundational event of Israelite identity (Exodus 12:43,48). ¶ The Passover celebration includes the sacrifice of a lamb without blemish, whose blood was originally applied to the doorposts and lintels of Israelite homes (Exodus 12:21). The meal involves eating the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, symbolizing haste and suffering (Exodus 12:8). ¶ Detailed instructions for observing Passover are found in Deuteronomy (Deuteronomy 16:1-6), and it was to be celebrated in the place God chose, later understood to be Jerusalem (Deuteronomy 16:2,6). The festival was central to Israelite worship and identity, with significant observances noted during the reigns of kings Hezekiah and Josiah (2 Chronicles 30:1-2, 35:1,18). ¶ Notable Passover celebrations include those led by Joshua after entering the Promised Land (Joshua 5:10-11), during King Josiah's reforms (2 Kings 23:21-23), and as described in Ezra during the return from exile (Ezra 6:19-20). ¶ In the New Testament, Passover plays a significant role in the narratives surrounding Jesus' crucifixion, which occurred during the festival. Jesus shared a Passover meal with His disciples, known as the Last Supper, which Christians commemorate as the institution of the Lord's Supper (Matthew 26:17-19; Mark 14:12-16; Luke 22:7-15). The apostle Paul refers to Christ as \"our Passover lamb\" who has been sacrificed (1 Corinthians 5:7). ¶ The festival's significance extends into Christian theology, symbolizing redemption and deliverance from sin, as noted in the epistle to the Hebrews, which highlights its faith aspect (Hebrews 11:28).",

    "longDescription": "The Pharisees were a prominent Jewish sect active during the Second Temple period and in the time of Jesus Christ. They were known for their strict observance of the Mosaic law and the oral traditions of the elders (Mark 7:3-5). The Pharisees believed in the resurrection of the dead, the existence of angels and spirits, and the importance of following legal traditions (Acts 23:6-8). ¶Throughout the Gospels, the Pharisees are often portrayed as legalistic, hypocritical, and self-righteous (Matthew 23). They frequently confronted Jesus about His teachings, practices, and claims to divine authority (Matthew 12:2, 14, 24; 15:1-12; 19:3; 22:15-46). Jesus rebuked them for their hypocrisy, legalism, and neglect of justice, mercy, and faithfulness (Matthew 23:23-28; Luke 11:37-54). ¶Despite this general characterization, some Pharisees are presented positively, such as Nicodemus, who sought Jesus's teaching (John 3:1-21), and those who warned Jesus of Herod's plot to kill Him (Luke 13:31). Some Pharisees even became followers of Christ, like the apostle Paul, who described himself as a Pharisee (Philippians 3:5; Acts 23:6). ¶After Jesus's death and resurrection, the Pharisees continued to oppose the early Christian church (Acts 5:34; 15:5). Paul's testimony about his former life as a Pharisee underscored the transformative power of his encounter with the risen Christ (Acts 26:5; Philippians 3:5-11). Despite their knowledge of Scripture, many Pharisees failed to recognize Jesus as the fulfillment of God's promises and the Messiah (John 9:13-41).",

The prophet Amos also mentions the Pleiades in Amos 5:8, where he describes God as the One who made the Pleiades and Orion, and who controls the cycle of day and night and the waters of the earth. These references to the Pleiades serve to highlight God's creative power, wisdom, and sovereign rule over the universe.",

In John's Gospel, the day of Preparation is also associated with the Passover, as it was the day before the Passover feast (John 19:14, 31, 42). Jesus was crucified on the day of Preparation and hastily buried before the Sabbath began at sundown (Matthew 27:62; Luke 23:54; John 19:42). The Gospel writers' mention of the day of Preparation helps to clarify the timeline of events surrounding Jesus's death and resurrection and underscores the urgency of His burial before the Sabbath.",

However, through the courageous intervention of Queen Esther and her cousin Mordecai, the Jews were delivered from Haman's evil plot, and Haman and his sons were hanged on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai (Esther 7:10; 9:25). ¶Following this great deliverance, Mordecai and Esther instituted the festival of Purim to commemorate these events (Esther 9:20-22). The celebration was to be observed annually on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar with feasting, rejoicing, and sending gifts to one another and to the poor (Esther 9:22, 28-32). The book of Esther was to be read during this festival as a reminder of God's providential care for His people (Esther 9:27, 28). The establishment of Purim as a lasting ordinance ensured that the memory of the Jews' deliverance would be preserved for future generations (Esther 9:28).",

It comes from the Aramaic word \"reqa,\" meaning \"empty-headed,\" \"worthless,\" or \"foolish.\" In this passage, Jesus warns that anyone who uses this insulting term against another person will be subject to judgment, equating it with murder. He emphasizes that the use of such disparaging language comes from an angry and murderous heart, which God will judge. The severity of the punishment Jesus describes underscores the seriousness of using contemptuous language and the importance of treating others with respect. Jesus' teaching on this matter highlights the deeper, spiritual meaning of the law against murder, showing that God is concerned not only with outward actions but also with the thoughts and attitudes of the heart.",

The name Rahab means \"proud\" or \"arrogant\" in Hebrew. In Job 9:13 and 26:12, Rahab is mentioned in the context of God's power over creation and His ability to subdue the forces of chaos. In Psalm 89:10, God is praised for crushing Rahab and scattering His enemies, using the defeat of this sea monster as a metaphor for His triumph over the nations. Similarly, in Isaiah 51:9, the prophet calls upon God to awaken and defeat Rahab as He did in ancient times, using this imagery to plead for God's intervention on behalf of His people. The use of Rahab as a poetic name for Egypt emphasizes the nation's pride and opposition to God, while also highlighting God's supreme power and authority over all earthly powers.",

In this passage, God rebukes the Israelites for offering sacrifices to false gods, including \"the star of your god Rephan,\" during the forty years in the wilderness. As a result of their idolatry, God declares that He will send them into exile beyond Babylon. The name Rephan is believed to be a reference to the Assyrian-Babylonian god of the planet Saturn, also known as Chiun or Kaiwan. Stephen's mention of Rephan serves to highlight Israel's recurring pattern of unfaithfulness to God and their persistent tendency to turn to idolatry, despite God's gracious deliverance and provision for them.",

After being healed of his leprosy by the prophet Elisha, Naaman acknowledges the God of Israel as the one true God and pledges to offer sacrifices only to Him. However, he asks for God's pardon in advance for one exception: when his master, the king of Syria, goes into the temple of Rimmon to worship and leans on Naaman's hand, causing Naaman to bow down in the temple. Naaman asks for God's understanding in this matter, recognizing the potential conflict between his newfound faith and his duties in the Syrian court. Elisha's response, \"Go in peace,\" suggests that God is merciful and understands Naaman's situation. The mention of Rimmon provides insight into the polytheistic religious context of ancient Syria and highlights the challenges faced by those who converted to faith in the God of Israel while living in pagan societies.",

    "longDescription": "The Sabbath is the seventh day of the week, set apart by God as a holy day for rest and worship. The word \"Sabbath\" comes from the Hebrew word \"shabbat,\" meaning \"to cease\" or \"to rest.\" The observance of the Sabbath was instituted by God at creation (Genesis 2:2-3) and later codified in the Ten Commandments (Exodus 20:8-11). ¶On the Sabbath, the Israelites were to refrain from all work and dedicate the day to God (Exodus 31:14-15; Leviticus 23:3). The Sabbath was a sign of the covenant between God and Israel, reminding them of their deliverance from slavery in Egypt (Deuteronomy 5:15). Specific regulations governed Sabbath observance, such as the prohibition of kindling a fire (Exodus 35:3) and the requirement to prepare food in advance (Exodus 16:23). ¶In the New Testament, Jesus affirmed the Sabbath as a day for doing good and ministering to others (Matthew 12:1-13; Luke 13:10-17). He declared Himself the Lord of the Sabbath (Matthew 12:8) and taught that the Sabbath was made for man's benefit (Mark 2:27). After Jesus' resurrection, the early church began to gather on the first day of the week, Sunday, to commemorate His resurrection (Acts 20:7; 1 Corinthians 16:2). ¶The Sabbath remains an important concept in Christian theology, with some denominations continuing to observe the seventh-day Sabbath, while others view Sunday as a day of rest and worship. The principle of setting apart time for rest and devotion to God continues to be an essential aspect of Christian faith and practice.",

    "longDescription": "The Sadducees were a Jewish sect active during the Second Temple period and in the time of Jesus Christ. They were known for their strict adherence to the written Torah and their rejection of oral traditions upheld by the Pharisees. The Sadducees did not believe in the resurrection of the dead, the existence of angels, or spirits (Acts 23:8). They were often associated with the wealthy and politically influential classes, including the high priestly families. ¶In the Gospels, the Sadducees are portrayed as opponents of Jesus, challenging Him on the issue of the resurrection (Matthew 22:23-33; Mark 12:18-27; Luke 20:27-40). Jesus refuted their arguments using Scripture, demonstrating that the resurrection is affirmed in the Torah. The Sadducees also joined forces with the Pharisees to oppose the early Christian church (Acts 4:1; 5:17). ¶The apostle Paul, when brought before the Sanhedrin, cleverly exploited the theological differences between the Pharisees and Sadducees to divide his opponents (Acts 23:6-10). The Sadducees' denial of the resurrection and the supernatural realm put them at odds with the core teachings of Christianity. Following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, the Sadducees faded from history, while the Pharisaic tradition continued to shape the development of Rabbinic Judaism.",

    "longDescription": "Satan, also known as the devil, is the chief adversary of God and the tempter of humanity. The name \"Satan\" comes from the Hebrew word meaning \"adversary\" or \"accuser.\" He is portrayed as a spiritual being who opposes God's purposes and seeks to lead people into sin and destruction. ¶In the Old Testament, Satan appears as an accuser in the heavenly court (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7; Zechariah 3:1-2). He challenges the integrity of Job and receives permission from God to test him. The Old Testament also uses the term \"satan\" or \"adversary\" to describe human opponents or obstacles (1 Samuel 29:4; 2 Samuel 19:22; 1 Kings 5:4). ¶In the New Testament, Satan is identified as the tempter of Jesus (Matthew 4:1-11; Mark 1:13; Luke 4:1-13), the oppressor of God's people (Luke 13:16; Acts 10:38), and the deceiver of the world (Revelation 12:9; 20:3, 8). He is also called the \"ruler of this world\" (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11) and the \"god of this age\" (2 Corinthians 4:4). ¶Jesus defeated Satan through His death and resurrection (Hebrews 2:14; 1 John 3:8), and believers are called to resist him (James 4:7; 1 Peter 5:8-9). The New Testament portrays Satan as a real and active spiritual adversary, but one whose power is limited and whose ultimate defeat is assured (Romans 16:20; Revelation 20:10). ¶Other names for Satan include Beelzebub (Matthew 10:25; 12:24-27), Belial (2 Corinthians 6:15), and the serpent (Revelation 12:9; 20:2). These names highlight his role as the leader of demons, the personification of evil, and the deceiver of humanity.",

    "longDescription": "Selah is a term that appears frequently in the Psalms and three times in the book of Habakkuk. It is likely a musical or liturgical direction, though its precise meaning is uncertain. The term \"selah\" is transliterated from the Hebrew and appears 71 times in the Psalms and 3 times in Habakkuk. ¶Selah often appears at the end of a verse or section, suggesting that it may have been used to indicate a pause, a musical interlude, or a call to reflect on the preceding words. Some scholars propose that it may have signaled a change in the musical accompaniment or a moment for the congregation to respond. ¶The Septuagint, the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament, often translates \"selah\" as \"diapsalma,\" which means \"pause\" or \"interlude.\" However, the exact meaning and function of the term remain unclear. ¶Despite the uncertainty surrounding its precise meaning, the use of selah in the Psalms and Habakkuk suggests that it served an important role in the worship and liturgical practices of ancient Israel. Its presence in these texts highlights the musical and meditative nature of these passages, inviting the reader or listener to pause and reflect on the message being conveyed.",

It is a winter month and usually consists of 30 days. ¶The month of Shebat is mentioned once in the Bible, in Zechariah 1:7. In this passage, the prophet Zechariah receives a series of visions on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius. This date serves as a temporal marker for the divine revelations given to Zechariah. ¶In later Jewish tradition, the fifteenth day of Shebat, known as Tu BiShvat, became a minor festival celebrating the \"New Year of the Trees.\" This date was significant for determining the age of trees for the purpose of tithing and other agricultural laws. ¶Apart from the single reference in Zechariah, the month of Shebat does not play a prominent role in the biblical narrative. Its mention in this passage helps to situate Zechariah's prophetic ministry within the historical context of the postexilic period and the reign of the Persian king Darius.",

Others propose that it denotes a musical part, perhaps the lowest or bass part. Another possibility is that Sheminith refers to a specific melody or musical mode. ¶In 1 Chronicles 15:21, Sheminith is mentioned in the context of King David's organization of Levite musicians to accompany the transportation of the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem. The passage states that certain musicians played harps \"according to Alamoth,\" while others played lyres \"according to Sheminith.\" This suggests that Sheminith may have been a musical term indicating a particular arrangement, tuning, or style of playing the lyres. ¶The use of Sheminith in the titles of Psalms 6 and 12 may indicate that these psalms were intended to be sung or played according to this specific musical arrangement or accompaniment. However, due to the lack of detailed information about ancient Israelite music, the precise meaning and application of Sheminith remain uncertain.",

After the Gileadites, under the leadership of Jephthah, defeated the Ammonites, the Ephraimites confronted Jephthah and accused him of not including them in the battle. This led to a violent conflict between the two Israelite tribes. ¶To identify the fleeing Ephraimites, the Gileadites used the word \"Shibboleth\" as a test. They asked each person attempting to cross the Jordan River to say \"Shibboleth.\" The Ephraimites, due to their dialect, could not pronounce the word correctly and instead said \"Sibboleth.\" This linguistic difference allowed the Gileadites to identify and kill 42,000 Ephraimites. ¶The word \"Shibboleth\" itself is not significant in its meaning; it is thought to refer to an ear of grain or a flowing stream. However, its use in this narrative highlights the linguistic and tribal differences among the Israelites and the deadly consequences of such divisions. ¶The term \"shibboleth\" has since entered the English language as a word referring to a custom, phrase, or belief that distinguishes one group from another, often used as a test of membership or loyalty.",

These were the Kenites who came from Hammath, the father of the house of Rechab.\" ¶This verse suggests that the Shimeathites, along with the Tirathites and Sucathites, were Kenite clans known for their scribal skills.

Others propose that it could be a symbolic reference to the beauty and delicacy of God's covenant with His people, using the lily as a metaphor. ¶The context of Psalm 60 provides some insight into the possible significance of Shushan Eduth. The psalm is attributed to David and is described as a Miktam, a term possibly indicating a specific type of psalm or musical composition. The historical background mentioned in the title refers to David's military victories over Aram and Edom. In the psalm itself, David expresses his trust in God's help and guidance despite the challenges and setbacks faced by the nation. ¶However, due to the limited information available, the precise meaning and application of Shushan Eduth in the context of Psalm 60 and biblical music remain uncertain.",

The name Sikkuth is thought to be derived from the Akkadian word \"sakkut,\" which means \"tent\" or \"shrine.\" This could indicate that Sikkuth was a deity worshipped in a portable shrine or tent-like structure. ¶The worship of Sikkuth, along with other pagan deities like Kiyyun, was a violation of the covenant between God and Israel, which prohibited the worship of other gods (Exodus 20:3-4). Amos's message warns the Israelites that their idolatry and disobedience would lead to judgment and exile. ¶The mention of Sikkuth in Amos 5:26 highlights the recurring problem of syncretism and idolatry in Israel's history, as the people often adopted the religious practices of the surrounding nations.

The new decree was written on the twenty-third day of Sivan, allowing the Jews to defend themselves against their enemies. ¶In later Jewish tradition, the festival of Shavuot (Pentecost) is celebrated on the sixth day of Sivan. This festival commemorates the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai and the harvest season. ¶Apart from the single reference in Esther, the month of Sivan does not play a prominent role in the biblical narrative.

They are mentioned in Acts 17:18 as one of the groups that the apostle Paul encountered and debated with during his visit to Athens. ¶Stoicism emphasized the importance of reason, self-control, and the acceptance of one's fate. Stoics believed in a divine, rational principle (logos) that governed the universe and that human beings should strive to live in accordance with this principle. They taught that the path to happiness and fulfillment was through virtue, wisdom, and the control of one's emotions and desires. ¶In Acts 17, Paul addresses a gathering of Athenian philosophers, including Stoics and Epicureans, at the Areopagus. Some of the Stoics initially dismissed Paul's teachings as \"babbling\" and mocked his proclamation of the resurrection of Jesus. However, others were intrigued and wanted to hear more, leading to Paul's famous speech about the \"Unknown God\" and the nature of the true God who created the world and calls all people to repentance. ¶The mention of the Stoics in Acts 17 highlights the intellectual and philosophical climate of ancient Athens and the challenges faced by early Christian missionaries in presenting the gospel message to a diverse and skeptical audience. Paul's engagement with the Stoics and other philosophical schools demonstrates his ability to contextualize the Christian message and to use reason and persuasion to communicate the truth of the gospel.",

In a vision, Ezekiel is shown the various abominations and idolatrous practices taking place in the temple, including the worship of Tammuz. ¶The verse states, \"Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the Lord, and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.\" This description suggests that the women were engaged in a ritual mourning ceremony for Tammuz, likely associated with the Mesopotamian myth of the dying and rising god. ¶In Mesopotamian mythology, Tammuz (also known as Dumuzi) was the god of shepherds and vegetation. He was believed to die each year, descending to the underworld, and then be resurrected, symbolizing the cycle of death and rebirth in nature. The worship of Tammuz often involved ritual mourning by women, who lamented his death and celebrated his resurrection. ¶The presence of women mourning for Tammuz in the Jerusalem temple was a clear violation of the commandment to worship only the God of Israel (Exodus 20:3-4). Ezekiel's vision emphasizes the extent to which idolatry had infiltrated the religious life of Judah, even within the sacred precincts of the temple. ¶The mention of Tammuz in Ezekiel 8 serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of syncretism and the importance of maintaining pure worship practices.

The verse states, \"The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.\" ¶Little is known about the specific characteristics or attributes of Tartak, as this deity is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible or in other historical sources. The name Tartak does not have a clear meaning or etymology in any known ancient Near Eastern language. ¶The worship of Tartak, along with other foreign deities, was practiced by the Avvites in Samaria alongside the worship of the Lord (2 Kings 17:33). This syncretistic religious practice was condemned by the biblical authors, who emphasized the importance of exclusive devotion to the God of Israel. ¶The mention of Tartak in 2 Kings 17 highlights the religious and cultural challenges faced by the Israelites living in Samaria after the Assyrian conquest, as they were influenced by the religious practices of the foreign peoples settled among them. This passage serves as a warning against compromising the worship of the true God by adopting the beliefs and practices of surrounding nations.",

The verse states, \"So Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus into his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.\" ¶The mention of Tebeth in this context helps to establish the timeline of events in the book of Esther and highlights the significant moment when Esther enters the royal palace, setting the stage for her eventual role in saving the Jewish people from Haman's plot. ¶In later Jewish tradition, the tenth of Tebeth is observed as a minor fast day, commemorating the beginning of the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar, which ultimately led to the destruction of the First Temple and the Babylonian exile.",

The Thummim, whose name is derived from the Hebrew word for \"perfection\" or \"completeness,\" were likely associated with the concept of divine truth and guidance. ¶In Numbers 27:21, God instructs Moses to have the high priest, Eleazar, use the Urim to seek divine guidance on behalf of Joshua and the Israelites.

Scribes in ancient Israel were responsible for writing, copying, and interpreting documents, including religious texts and legal contracts. The mention of these clans living in Jabez, a town associated with the Kenites, indicates that they may have been recognized for their expertise in this profession. ¶The Kenites were a nomadic tribe closely associated with the Israelites, known for their metalworking and scribal abilities. Some notable Kenites in the Bible include Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, and Heber, whose wife Jael killed the Canaanite general Sisera. ¶Apart from this brief mention in 1 Chronicles, no further information is provided about the Tirathites in the Bible.

It was a time to bring offerings to the Lord from the firstfruits of the harvest (Numbers 28:26). The Feast of Weeks also commemorated the giving of the Law to Moses at Mount Sinai, which traditionally occurred fifty days after the Exodus. In later Jewish tradition, it became a celebration of the Torah and God's covenant with Israel. The festival was observed at the Temple in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 8:13). In the New Testament, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the early Christians occurred on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1), fifty days after Jesus' resurrection. The apostle Paul also sought to be in Jerusalem for Pentecost during his missionary journeys (Acts 20:16, 1 Corinthians 16:8). The Feast of Weeks or Pentecost held both agricultural and spiritual significance for the Jewish people, celebrating God's provision and His covenant relationship with them.",

This suggests that Simon may have been associated with or sympathetic to the Zealot movement before becoming a follower of Jesus. ¶The Zealots played a significant role in the Jewish Revolt against Rome (AD 66-73), which ultimately led to the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. They were known for their guerrilla warfare tactics and their willingness to engage in violent resistance against the Roman authorities. ¶While the Zealots are not mentioned extensively in the Bible, their presence in the New Testament highlights the complex political and religious landscape of first-century Judea, as well as the diverse backgrounds of Jesus' disciples.",

After Paul healed a man who had been lame from birth, the people of Lystra identified Barnabas with Zeus and Paul with Hermes, believing them to be gods in human form. ¶The priest of Zeus, whose temple was located just outside the city, brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates, intending to offer sacrifices to Paul and Barnabas. However, the apostles tore their clothes and rushed into the crowd, urging them not to worship them as gods but to turn to the living God who created the heavens and the earth. ¶This incident highlights the prevalence of polytheistic beliefs in the Greco-Roman world and the challenge that early Christian missionaries faced in proclaiming the message of the one true God. It also demonstrates the apostles' commitment to rejecting any form of idolatry or misplaced worship, even when it was directed towards them.",

This marked a significant milestone in the history of Israel, as the Temple would become the central place of worship for the Jewish people. ¶Later in the same chapter, 1 Kings 6:37 specifies that the foundation of the Temple was laid in the month of Ziv, again emphasizing the importance of this month in the construction process. ¶The name \"Ziv\" is derived from the Hebrew word for \"brightness\" or \"splendor,\" which may be a reference to the bright sunlight and the blossoming of flowers that typically occur during this time of year in the region. ¶The mention of Ziv in the context of the Temple's construction highlights the importance of sacred time and the alignment of religious events with the natural cycles of the year in ancient Israelite culture.",
