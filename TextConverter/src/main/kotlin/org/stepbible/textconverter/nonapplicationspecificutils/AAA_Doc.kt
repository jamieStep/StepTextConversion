/**
* Miscellaneous utilities.  My aim here has been to group together utilities
* which are not bound intimately to the application.  Having said which, of
* course, that's rather in the eye of the beholder: many (but certainly not all)
* of these assume that we are dealing with some kind of Bible text processing,
* and moreover processing which supports USX and OSIS.  They are independent of
* the application only to the extent that another roughly similar application
* would probably benefit from much the same facilities.
