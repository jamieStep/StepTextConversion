#! Default vernacular transtepExternalDataPath_DblWebsitelation strings
#! ======================================
#!
#! See _readMeFirst_.txt for information about the syntax used below.
#!
#! There are potentially two kinds of vernacular-specific information.
#!
#! One is concerned with things like what constructs in OSIS should be used to
#! represent the USX we have been given.  In general, in fact, this probably
#! _isn't_ particularly sensitive to the vernacular we are using, so almost
#! certainly you won't need to change it.  But in case you do, the basic
#! definitions can be found in defaultVernacularFormatting.conf, and that file
#! tells you what you need to do.
#!
#! The other kind of vernacular-specific information in the main is translatable
#! text -- ie text which we are likely to want to translate into vernacular form
#! where we are able to do so.  In general (but not exclusively) this text
#! turns up in footnotes.  (It also appears in things which don't really look
#! like 'proper' text at all.  For instance, at one point we were putting
#! certain information in square brackets, but needed a vernacular definition
#! because in some vernaculars square brackets may not be available, or may not
#! carry the right semantics.)
#!
#! The system always attempts to render these messages in vernacular form, but
#! if it finds it lacks a particular translation, it simply uses the English
#! version.
#!
#! It is this with which we are concerned in this present file, and it is the
#! definitions here which you may want to override for other vernaculars.
#! Indeed, not only for other vernaculars: if you wanted to override the text
#! here for some specific English text, you can do that too.
#!
#! I recommend putting all of the vernacular translations into a single config
#! file.  This raises the question of where you should store that file.  You
#! can, of course, put it anywhere whose location the facilities here can get
#! at -- within the Metadata folder for a given text, within a folder relative
#! to the Metadata folder, or -- if you are in a position to rebuild the library
#! jar file -- in the resources section of the jar file.
#!
#! Putting it somewhere other than within the Metadata folder potentially makes
#! it available for use by multiple texts, so you will need to decide whether
#! that is useful.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! The gory detail
#! ===============
#!
#! There's quite a lot to this, so we'll sidle up to it gently, by way of a
#! couple of typical examples.  These don't use _all_ of the available
#! facilities, so we'll need to come back to the detail later, but they do
#! demonstrate the things used most commonly at present. 
#!
#! The simplest form is :-
#!
#!   V_reversification_inSomeBiblesThisChapterIsASeparateBook=In manchen Bibeln ist dieses Kapitel ein separates Buch.
#!
#! This looks pretty much like a typical definition for a metadata item --
#! key=value.
#!
#! The key can be anything you like.  The convention I have adopted, however, is
#! to use 'V_' as a prefix, then an indication of the portion of the processing
#! with which the text is concerned, and then a string based upon the content of
#! the text string.  (The V_ here is supposed to stand for 'Vernacular'
#! incidentally.  This is slightly misleading, in that I also use V_ on the
#! default (English) texts, even though I have adopted the parochial viewpoint
#! that English is the only 'real' language and is therefore not a
#! vernacular.)
#!
#! In the example above, the key is associated with a fixed text --
#! 'In manchen Bibeln ist dieses Kapitel ein separates Buch.'.
#!
#!
#! Moving on to a slightly more complicated example :-
#!
#!   v_reversification_inSomeBiblesThisBookIsFoundAt=In manchen Bibeln steht dieses Buch in %RefV<bcVs->.
#!
#! The important difference here is the '%RefV<bcVs->', which says that at this
#! point in the string, you want to substitute a reference.  '%RefV<bcVs->' acts
#! as a placeholder to indicate where the reference should go, and it also
#! indicates how the reference should be formatted.
#!
#! Note that these substitutions rely upon the processing being set up
#! internally in a particular way (or they do in most cases).  If you say that
#! you need to have a reference placed into the text, the processing must be
#! organised to supply a reference when processing that message.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! As aside on String.format and parameter lists
#! =============================================
#!
#! The processing of these texts is modelled upon the Java String.format
#! method.  This takes as its first argument a format string like the ones in
#! the above example (eg 'In manchen Bibeln steht dieses Buch in %RefV<bcVs->.')
#! and then an arbitrary number of additional arguments which supply the values
#! to be substituted for the placeholders.
#!
#! By default, the arguments are assumed to follow the same order as the
#! placeholders, so that placeholder 1 is replaced by argument 1, etc.
#! However, String.format also supports an alternative, such that a placeholder
#! includes an indication of the 1-based ordinal number of the argument used
#! to fill it in.  Thus, for instance, if you have '%2$d', the '%d' part says
#! that the corresponding argument is an integer, and should be formatted as
#! such; and the '2' says this placeholder should be replaced by argument 2 in
#! the list.  I do support this, but I do not recommend it.
#!
#! Instead, I recommend giving each parameter a name, and using that instead --
#! eg '%myCount$d'.  Of course this relies upon the processing knowing, when it
#! handles this particular piece of text, that it has to have an integer
#! argument and has to have associated with it the name 'myCount'; but then
#! whatever you do, the processing has to have been set up appropriately in some
#! manner or other.
#!
#! In fact, having said all of this, you will notice in the example above --
#!
#!  In manchen Bibeln steht dieses Buch in %RefV<bcVs->.
#!
#! that I don't actually have a name at all.  This is because I happen to know
#! (being privy to the internals of the processing) that when these
#! particular messages are processed, there is only one argument, and therefore
#! there is no possibility of ambiguity.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! Substitution parameters -- references
#! =====================================
#!
#! Again, there is a fair bit to this, so we'll start off with the common case
#! and then deal with the others afterwards.  And the common case is a
#! reference, which in full detail looks like this :-
#!
#!    %theRef$RefV<bcVs>
#!
#! Spreading this out to make it easier to see what's going on, we have :-
#!
#!  %           Marks this as a placeholder.
#!  theRef      Name of the argument, as above.  Optional if there is only one.
#!  $           Marks the end of the name.
#!  Ref         Says this is a reference format.
#!  V           Says we want the reference to come out in vernacular format.
#!  <           Marks the start of the format description.
#!  bcVs        The format description itself.
#!  >           Marks the end of the format description.
#!
#! 'V' above stands for Vernacular.  Alternatives are O(SIS) and U(SX).  If you
#! do not have a vernacular equivalent for the current Bible, then references
#! will be rendered in USX form even if you ask for vernacular.
#!
#! IMPORTANT: In this present file, I have used $RefU throughout.  This is
#! because these are English messages, and may be used as a fallback if
#! vernacular translations are not available.  If we fall back to an English
#! text, it looks a bit odd if the text then contains references in vernacular
#! form.  However, if you are creating a vernacular file based upon this present
#! one, you should use $RefV throughout.
#!
#! The format description (bcVs in the example) describes which elements of
#! the reference are required -- b(ook), c(hapter), v(erse) and s(ubverse).
#!
#! There is a lot of flexibility regarding the way in which references (and
#! reference ranges and collections) are rendered, but unfortunately the flip
#! side is that there is a lot to read through.  So, grab a cup of coffee, and
#! here goes ...
#!
#!
#!
#! Individual references
#! ---------------------
#!
#! The format string may be some combination of bcvs, or it may be 'a'.  If
#! null, bcvs is assumed.  b may be replaced by one of b-, b= or b+.  And
#! any one of the characters may be in upper case ...
#!
#! The easy option is 'a' (for 'as-is').  In this case, we simply write out
#! the supplied reference based upon elements which were overtly supplied at
#! the time it was read (as opposed to elements which may have been
#! defaulted).  Thus if 3:16 were read, 3:16 would be written out, even if
#! we had been able to deduce that the reference actually referred to John
#! and had therefore filled in the book into the internal reference structure
#! based on that knowledge.
#!
#! Moving on, if something appears in upper case, it _must_ be included in
#! the output.  So if you have a format string like Bcvs, you will definitely
#! get the book name in the output.  If the reference you are trying to
#! process lacks this element, processing will be aborted (or it may be if I
#! think it's really worthwhile implementing the test).
#!
#! If an element appears in lower case, you're happy to have it output, but
#! equally can live without if appropriate (this has to do with handling the
#! context, which is covered shortly).  So if you have, say, bCv, you are
#! saying that you are happy to have the book and verse if appropriate, that
#! you _must_ have the chapter, and that you don't want the subverse.
#!
#! Incidentally, b-, b= and c+ respectively force the output to give the
#! abbreviated, sort or long form of the book name if available.  (If no
#! details of the requested type of name were provided, the processing
#! will do its best with what's available.)  'b' on its own means to use
#! whatever default was specified in the configuration data.  The default
#! default, as it were, is abbreviated.  (And you can of course have all
#! of these in upper case too -- B, B-, B=, B+.)
#!
#! Moving on to the use of any context value.  If a context variable is
#! supplied, then leading elements which are the same between the supplied
#! reference and the context reference are candidates for omission -- and
#! will be omitted unless a capital letter in the format string forces the
#! issue.  So, if the reference to be output is Jn 3:16 and the context
#! value is Jn 3, and you use a format string of bcvs, the output will be
#! just '16', because b and c are the same.  But if you give bCvs, the
#! output will be 3:16, because you are forcing the chapter to be displayed
#! (and by implication everything after it).  Note, incidentally, that
#! there is no harm in including in the format string something -- 's'
#! in this case -- which does not appear in the reference to be handled:
#! it will simply be ignored.
#!
#!
#!
#! Compound references
#! -------------------
#!
#! We turn now to ranges and collections.
#!
#! In full form, format strings here consist of two parts, comma-separated.
#! The first indicates how the first element of the range or collection is to
#! be handled; and the second indicates how all remaining elements are to be
#! handled.  The second is optional.  If omitted it is taken as bcvs.  And the
#! format string itself is optional, in which case it is treated as though
#! both parts were bcvs.
#!
#! The first reference is handled in the way described above, taking the first
#! part of the format string and any supplied defaults.  The second and
#! subsequent elements are handled using the second part of the format string,
#! and taking the previous element as the context (in a collection, if the
#! previous element was a range, we use the top of the range as the default
#! for the next item in the collection).
#!
#!
#!
#! One final point
#! ---------------
#!
#! If you specify a reference format like this, and the parameter available to
#! fill in the placeholder happens not to be parseable as a reference, it will
#! simply be output as a string.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! Other substitution parameters
#! =============================
#!
#! A place-holder of the form @(xxx) is replaced by the value associated with
#! the key 'xxx' in the metadata.
#!
#! There are two ways this can work.  'xxx' can be the name of a metadata
#! parameter.  (This always works -- the processing is already set up to
#! handle this, and therefore does not need to be altered on a case-by-case
#! basis.)
#!
#! Or 'xxx' can be a name which has been associated with a value by the
#! processing.
#!
#! An example may help -- an example combining both of these.  Suppose your
#! text is :-
#!
#!    @(stepBibleNameEnglish) contains @(nBooks) books
#!
#! stepBibleNameEnglish is the name of a metadata parameter (it is something
#! you are required to supply in your configuration file), so its value is
#! taken from that.  And you are relying upon the processing itself associating
#! the name 'nBooks' with some value or other.
#!
#! Thus if stepBibleNameEnglish has the value 'The King James Version' and
#! nBooks has been associated by the processing with the value 66 (which here
#! must be a text string, because we have not specified any formatting), the
#! final string would be :-
#!
#!    The King James Version contains 66 books.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! General considerations
#! ======================
#!
#! * $ ( ) and \ are special characters.  If you want to include any of these
#!   characters as such in your text, you need to precede it with a backslash.
#!
#! * It is probably safest to work on the assumption that everything is case-
#!   sensitive.
#!
#! * There is nothing to prevent you from including, in your text, reference to
#!   an item which itself contains further references or processing directives
#!   -- the processing will handle all of this correctly (I hope ...).  So if
#!   there were a metadata parameter called 'time' and your text included
#!   '@(time)', that portion of the text would be replaced by the value of the
#!   metadata parameter 'time'.  If the value associated with the metadata
#!   parameter were itself something like '@(hours):@(mins)', then it would be
#!   expanded out again to obtain the values associated with the parameters
#!   'hours' and 'mins'.
#!
#! * If the processing is unable to resolve all references, it will raise an
#!   error and give up.

#!
#! contentForEmptyVerse gives a text string to be placed in the 'empty'

#! generated where a verse was missing from the original text, and this is

#! Text reflecting reversification and / or how other versification traditions
#! treat a particular verse.
#!
#! Note that all of the values used with reversification _look_ as though they
#! are scripture references.  However, some of them are not in standard format,
#! and these will simply be output as-is, regardless of any formatting details
#! you may have provided.
#!
#! It is difficult to get the reference formats correct here, in order to align
#! them with DIB's preferences.  In general, I use a-a, which arranges for
#! the output to contain only those elements which appeared in the input.
#!
#! There is a further complication, in that there was a significant change to
