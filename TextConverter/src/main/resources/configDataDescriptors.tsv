stepBibleDescriptionAsItAppearsOnBiblePicker	The brief description of the Bible which appears on the Bible chooser in STEP.  Typically made up of a number of elements, but you can override that by specifying a value for stepBibleDescriptionAsItAppearsOnBibleListOverride.	UserSpecifiedOrCalculated	OptionalOrCalculated			FileOrCalculated	PerTextIfNecessary	Typically you allow this to be calculated, because the format is complicated.  But particularly when updating older modules, you may want to keep the previous value, in which case you can specify that value in a configuration file.

However, there is no guarantee that another text supplier may not use this same id.  stepDisambiguatorForId allows you to specify a string which is prepended to the id which hopefully will make clashes less likely.  If you don't supply something, the processing will determine a value for itself, although the absolute backstop is to use the string 'Unknown'.	UserSpecifiedOrCalculated	Optional	"Unknown"	Arbitrary string.	File	PerTextIfAvailable


# Description of language or script.
stepSuppliedCountryCode	Country code for module.	UserSpecified	Optional		A country code.	File	PerTextIfAvailable

You can also specify eg tag:attr -> tag, to remove the attribute altogether.	UserSpecified	Optional		String with particular format.	File	PerTextIfNecessary
stepVlCommentMarker	Used when processing VL to indicate how comments (if any) are marked in the VL text.	UserSpecified	Optional		Arbitrary string.	File	PerTextIfNecessary

stepOkToGenerateFootnotes	Says whether it is ok to generate footnotes (depending upon licence conditions, it may not be).	UserSpecifiedOrCalculated	Calculated	No if copyright text, otherwise yes.		File	PerTextIfNecessary	You can force the matter by overtly specifying a value.
stepReversificationFootnoteLevel	Indicates the type of footnotes to be generated on verses affected by reversification.	UserSpecified	MandatorySometimes	Basic	Basic / Academic / <Empty>.	File	PerTextIfNecessary	Needed when performing conversion time or runtime reversification.
stepUseVernacularFormats	Used to force the processing to use vernacular formats for any references which it generates.  You will seldom want this to be Yes, because obtaining details of how references are formatted is onerous.	UserSpecified	MandatoryAlways	No	Yes / No.	File	PerTextIfNecessary
stepValidationReportOutOfOrderAsError	Determines whether out-of-order verses are reported as an error.	UserSpecified	MandatoryAlways	Yes	Yes / No.	File	PerTextIfNecessary	Sometimes translators may deliberately put verses out of order, and we may need to accept this.

I'm assuming not because of needing to pick up the right DLLs on Windows.
stepTextConverterOverallDataRoot	It may be convenient to store _all_ data under a given folder.  If you define this variable to identify that folder, you can then use relative paths elsewhere, and have things work relative to this one.  That way, it's easy to move everything to a new location if necessary.	UserSpecified	Optional		Path.	EnvironmentVariable	IfYouOptToUseThis

stepStartProcessFromOsis	Used where we have non-OSIS inputs available, but nonetheless want to start from the current OSIS.	UserSpecified	Optional	No	Yes / No.	CommandLine	PerTextIfDesired	Where alternative inputs are available, you will be warned if you opt to use OSIS and the other inputs are more up to date.

stepSupplierUpdateReason	Where the new module is being produced because the supplier has changed things, details of those changes.	UserSpecified	Optional		Arbitrary string.	CommandLine	PerRunIfNecessary
stepSwordSoftwareDefaultVersion	The default version of Sword software needed to render the module.  There is a default value for this, so you shouldn't normally need to set it.	UserSpecified	MandatoryAlways	1.7.2	Arbitrary string.	File	IfCrosswireInternalsChange
stepTargetAudience	Determines whether we are building a STEP-internal or a public facing module.	UserSpecified	MandatorySometimes	Calculated	Public / Step.
