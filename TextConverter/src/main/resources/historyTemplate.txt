#! This file contains the history information.  It is automatically maintained by
#! the converter, but you can make changes to it if necessary, so long as you
#! follow these rules:
#!
#! - A history line must look like
#!
#!    History_1.2 2023-11-01 [SupplierVersion: 1234] SupplierReason: blah.
#!
#!   Where 1.2 is our version number; the date is the date the module was
#!   created (obviously nothing checks this, so you can pretty much get away
#!   with anything); the SupplierVersion is the version identifier assigned by
#!   the text supplier, or Unknown if you don't know; and the remainder of the
#!   text is either SupplierReason followed by text for a major revision, or
#!   StepReason followed by text for a minor one, or for the very first release.
#!
#!
#! - History lines should appear in the file in reverse chronological order (ie
#!   most recent first).
#!
#! - There is no need to create the first version of the file yourself, and
#!   indeed you should not do so.  The processing will create it for you.
#!
#! - Don't make any changes to the file other than modifying the history lines
#!   in accordance with the above instructions.
#!
#! - Don't remove _all_ of the history lines for the file.
#!
#!
#!
#! Somewhat arbitrarily, I have decided that any release occasioned by any kind
#! of change at all from the text suppliers is a major release, resulting in the
#! first element of the STEP revision being incremented.  Any release arising
#! from changes to the converter software is a minor rlease, resulting in the
#! second element of the STEP revision being incremented.
