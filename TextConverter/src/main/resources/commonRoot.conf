#! Default configuration definitions.
#!
#! This file contains default definitions for a lot of things which are
#! defaultable.  All of these are given as non-forced assignments, so that
#! other things can override them easily.
#!
#! I also include here references to some other parameters to which I am not
#! assigning values, so as to draw attention to their existence.  All of these
#! are marked %%%UNDEFINED, meaning that if anything wants to make use of them,
#! they will need to have an explicit value assigned somewhere.
#!
#! I have to admit that I've not been very consistent in this last respect.

stepReversificationFootnoteLevel=Basic     #! Basic / Academic or leave empty.

stepManualOsis2mod=No  #! Yes or No (not case-sensitive).  Normally osis2mod runs
                       #! under control of the program.  Occasionally this
                       #! doesn't seem to work, and in these cases you can have
                       #! the program pause to let you run osis2mod manually.

stepValidationReportOutOfOrderAsError=Yes   #! Yes or No (not case-sensitive).
                                            #! Normally it's an error if a text
                                            #! contains verses which are out of
                                            #! order, but occasionally
                                            #! translators deliberately put
                                            #! verses out of order.

stepUseExistingOsis=No #! Says whether we should start from existing OSIS in
                       #! preference to other inputs.  Options are Yes, No
                       #! and AsIs.  The latter means that we don't want the
                       #! OSIS to go through our normal processing.  Slightly
                       #! risky, since that processing is normally kind of
                       #! necessary, but the idea is that this OSIS is known
                       #! to be trustworthy, and we don't want to risk
                       #! screwing it up.

#! Version
#! =======
#!
#! Something which uniquely identified a particular version of a given text.
#! Usually you can probably rely upon the text supplier giving you something
#! suitable (or perhaps the repository from which the text was obtained -- DBL,
#! for instance, requires the metadata for all texts to contain a version
#! number).
#!
#! If you aren't given anything suitable, you'll just have to make something up.
#!
#! The format doesn't matter (ie you can go with whatever you're given),
#! except that it should not contain spaces.
#!
#! Note that STEP also maintains its own version number, independent of this --
#! something of the form eg 1.2, where 1 is the major version number and 2 is
#! minor version number.  I'd prefer not to have this second version number,
#! but Crosswire mandate the format of version numbers, and there's no guarantee
#! that version numbers supplied by third parties will fit with this.
