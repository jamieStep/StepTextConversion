#!
#! Common configuration
#! ====================
#!
#! Each text needs a Metadata/config.conf file, to which end, you should copy
#! this present file and then change it as necessary.
#!
#! There are an awful lot of configuration parameters which you may usefully
#! want to change (usefully in the sense that changing them may actually do
#! something), but for most texts there will be relatively few which you _need_
#! to change, and probably all of them are referred to here.
#!
#! In general, the items here split into two categories -- those for which I
#! have already supplied values, and those which I have recorded as requiring
#! a value.
#!
#! Where I have supplied values, very often it is to force things to be 'safe'
#! by default -- for example, to force validation.  You may actually require a
#! more laid back attitude with some texts, which you can achieve by altering
#! these values, but at least by setting 'safe' values here, you are forced to
#! make that call consciously.
#!
#! Where I have _not_ supplied values, in general it is because it is not
#! possible to come up with a default setting -- for example with things
#! like the website address for the owning organisation.  Here in general I give
#! the associated value as @Mandatory or @MandatoryMayBeEmpty.  In both cases
#! you must overtly include a definition for the item, but in the latter case,
#! you can give value as empty (ie can omit anything to the right of teh equals
#! sign) if no specific value is available.
#!
#! Note that definitions are included here to permit you to pick up information
#! from external metadata files (such as those supplied by DBL), and if you do
#! that, the definitions you give here may be overridden by settings associated
#! with these external sources
#!
#! As a particular example, you can specify here whether a particular module
#! should be encrypted, but if you indicate that the text has been supplied
#! by Biblica, the setting will be forced to Yes irrespective of what appears
#! in this present file.  Similarly there are some definitions which may be
#! satisfied from the metadata.xml files supplied with texts from DBL.
#!
#! In summary, therefore, having copied the present file to the Metadata folder
#! for your text, your task is to change your copy of the file as follows:
#!
#! - Set stepFileSelectorForOwnerOrganisation to 'Biblica' on texts supplied by
#!   Biblica.
#!
#! - Set stepFileSelectorForExternalDataFormat to 'Dbl' on texts obtained from
#!   DBL (assuming you want to pick up settings from the DBL metadata).
#!
#! - Check all of the other settings in the present file, and alter or fill
#!   them in as necessary.
#!
#! - Add any other definitions you may require (either directly within your
#!   copy of the present file, or via $include's of your own files).  The
#!   rationale for doing this is somewhat limited, though.  You might do it
#!   in order to override some of the default definitions in the various
#!   configuration files which are stored in the JAR's Resources section;
#!   or you might do it, for example, in order to set up your own
#!   vernacular translations for standard footnote texts (discussed in
#!   more detail below).  Apart from that, there is probably little reason
#!   for you to add your own definitions.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! Terminology
#! ===========
#!
#! TextOwnerOrganisation refers to the organisation which owns the copyright
#! or has other rights over the text.
#!
#! TextRepository organisation refers to the organisation which runs the
#! repository from which the text was obtained.
#!
#! The two may or may not be the same.  For example, Biblica texts are typically
#! held in the DBL database, so the text owner is Biblica, and the text
#! repository is DBL.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! Use of markup
#! =============
#!
#! Some of the information here ends up being displayed eg on copyright pages in
#! STEP.  In most (all?) cases, the values associated with these items can be
#! given in the form of HTML markup.
#!
#! Strictly, in fact, we should not be using HTML -- we should limit ourselves
#! to the markup defined by Crosswire, because there is no guarantee in general
#! that if we supply a module to a third party, it will be displayed in a
#! browser.  However, HTML works for us, and since we're already being pushed
#! into non-compliance in other areas, this probably doesn't really make things
#! much worse.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! Vernacular translations
#! =======================
#!
#! One particular reason for wanting to add extra definitions beyond the ones
#! which appear in this file is to provide vernacular translations of the
#! various standard footnote texts which the system uses, or to add your own
#! definitions detailing how scripture references are formatted in the text you
#! are processing.
#!
#! The easiest way to do this is to take your own copy of
#! Resources/ReferenceFormats/referenceFormatVernacularDefaults.conf and / or
#! Resources/TextTranslations/vernacularTextTranslations.conf (or of those
#! definitions within these files which you need to override), and then
#! define things appropriately.
#!
#! You can include these definitions either directly within your copy of
#! config.conf, or within other include files of your own.  (The latter
#! approach has the advantage that if you co-locate the root folders of all
#! texts which have shared requirements in this respect, you can share just
#! one copy of the include files.)
#!
#! If you _do_ opt to use separate include files, I recommend calling them
#! vernacularTextTranslations_xxx.conf or referenceFormats_xxx.conf, where
#! xxx is the 3-character ISO code for the language.

#!
#! If you understand what you're doing, you can insert anything you want here,
#! bearing in mind that in general later definitions override earlier ones, and
#! therefore any definitions introduced via the $include'd files mentioned below
#! will override your definitions.
#!
#! Most likely, you may want to include definitions of the form:
#!
#!   someName#=someValue (note the hash sign)
#!
#! where the #= lets you give definitions which will _not_ be overridden by
#! later ones.
#!
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#! INSERT ANY DEFINITIONS HERE.


#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#!
#! You need supply stepFileSelectorForOwnerOrganisation and / or
#! stepFileSelectorForExternalDataFormat only if you are working with texts for
#! which there is standard information available (which, at the time of writing,
#! means a) anything from the DBL library, and b) anything supplied to us by
#! Biblica. Both should use sentence case.
#!
#! stepFileSelectorForOwnerOrganisation lets the system pick up standard
#! information for the owner organisation where available (and at present,
#! it's only available for Biblica).  Otherwise you'd have to define anything
#! necessary yourself.  It majors on things like copyright conditions,
#! licensing terms, etc.
#!
#! stepFileSelectorForExternalDataFormat lets you pick up standard definitions
#! relating to a given data repository.  Usually the main or only purpose of
#! this is to make use of functionality built into the system which extracts
#! configuration information automatically from configuration files supplied by
#! that organisation.  For example, this makes it possible to pick up
#! information directly from the metadata.xml files supplied by Biblica, rather
#! than having to transcribe it manually.
#!
#1 Make sure you use '#=', and not just '=', for these two definitions.
#!
#! Use '#=' here to prevent anything else from overriding these definitions.
#!
#! If you use these definitions, they must come before the $include for
#! $common/commonForTargetSword.conf
#!

stepFileSelectorForOwnerOrganisation#=     #! eg Biblica, which is the only special case we support at present.  Leave empty if not wanted.

#!
#! Final validation normally checks verse ordering and reports as an error places
#! where things are out of order.  However, some texts (at the time of writing,
#! notably deu_HFA) have things which are out of order in the first place.  The
#! setting below tells the processing whether to report errors or warnings
#! when things are out of order (assuming that validation is being applied --
#! this is controlled not by a configuration parameter, but by a compile-time
#! flag).
#!

stepValidationReportOutOfOrderAsError=Yes

#!
#! Sometimes we may want to make fairly significant changes to a text
#! (particularly in support of reversification).  My assumption is that we may
#! not always want to do this, because it may violate copyright conditions.
#!
#! Admittedly, this may be a fairly blunt instrument -- for example, some
#! publishers may be happy for us to add footnotes but not to alter the text,
#! while others may not accept any changes at all, and I do not go down to that
#! level of granularity.
#!
#! This setting lets you indicate overtly whether you are are barred from making
#! 'significant' changes.  Yes always means Yes.  No doesn't necessarily mean
#! no, though -- if the 'About' information for a text contains the copyright
#! symbol, or the trademark symbol, or contains the word 'copyright', any value
#! specified for this setting is ignored, and the value is assumed to be Yes.

#!
#! Type of reversification required.  You _can_ set this from the command line
#! (and at the time of writing, that's what I've always done), but if you rely
#! on that, you won't be able to use the automated processing to run over all
#! texts and rebuild them (because the automated processing does not let you
#! stipulate command-line parameters for each text for the converter).
#!
#! Any command-line setting takes priority.

stepReversificationType=None

#! processing for Metadata.get/"stepHasAddedValue" will need to be changed
#! to accommodate them.  Look also for a reference to stepHasAddedValue in
#! ConverterOsisToSwordController, because there is a following para which adds
#! information about the various added value to the copyright page, and this
#! will need changing too.

#!
#! These two between them give the major and minor revision numbers for the text
#! itself.  Very often these will come from the translating organisation.  This
#! is slightly complicated ...
#!
#! * In recent translations, this is likely to come from the owning
#!   organisation.  If you don't have anything available, you'll need to make up
#!   a value, for the major revision at least.  1.0 is probably as good as
#!   anything.
#!
#! * Sword mandates (or at any rate strongly recommends) a major revision like
#!   9.8.  The minor revision is optional, but if supplied should be an
#!   integer.  What should be done to satisfy Crosswire's requirements if the
#!   translating organisation doesn't use revision indicators of this form (or
#!   doesn't make them available), I don't know.
#!
#! * There seems to be no provision for a version number of our own -- for
#!   example, if we have to reissue the same text more than once because of
#!   earlier errors in the conversion process.
#!
#! * If you have a revision number which already includes the minor revision
#!   (and is of the form 1.2.3), give the full revision number as the major
#!   number, and leave the minor number as '{empty}'.

#!
#! Module naming is far more complicated than I would like.  To a first
#! approximation, it is based upon the name of the root folder for the text,
#! which is of the form eg en_KJV, where the part before the underscore is a 2-
#! or 3- character language code, and the rest is an abbreviation for the text.
#! However, we then said that partly to reflect our own involvement, and partly
#! to avoid ambiguous module names, we'd add an underscore on the end of names
#! where STEP had added value (or rather, where it had made significant
#! changes).  At one stage this was to have been _sb ('sb' for STEP Bible), but
#! we then decided this might make it appear we were claiming too much for our
#! own efforts in comparison with those of the translators, and so we dropped
#! back to using just an underscore.
#!
#! However, on 13-Apr-22, DIB has suggested that because of the shortage of
#! screen real-estate on phones etc, even this modest decoration will often be
#! too much.  So although we need to retain the option to add the underscore, it
#! now appears that we need to be able to control whether this actually happens
#! or not -- hence the setting below.  (The idea is that we will use it only
#! where things would be ambiguous without.)

stepDecorateModuleNamesWhereStepHasAddedValue=No



#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#!
#! A little difficult to explain ...
#!
#! First off, this is not actually relevant to the processing at all, beyond
#! the fact that it will store it somewhere or other.  I am including it purely
#! to give us a unique id which might be of use to any admin tool we develop.
#!
#! So, what we are trying to achieve here is a unique id.  Often a publisher
#! (or a repository such as DBL) give the texts their own unique id, and you
#! can store this against stepTextIdSuppliedBySourceRepositoryOrOwnerOrganisation.
#!
#! However, although this id may be unique across the texts managed by that
#! organisation, there is no guarantee it will be globally unique -- another
#! organisation may use the same id.
#!
#! To attempt to ensure global uniqueness, you can specify any string you like
#! for stepDisambiguatorForId (you might perhaps choose 'DBL' for a DBL text
#! for instance).  The two values are then used jointly as the id.
#!
#! Because these are not actually used by the processing, you are at liberty
#! to make the assumption that in fact we shan't get round to implementing any
#! admin tool which relies upon them, and therefore given them both as
#! '{empty}'.
