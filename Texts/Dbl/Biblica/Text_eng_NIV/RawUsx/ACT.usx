  <para style="im">Luke’s second volume is known as the book of Acts (see <char style="xt">the Invitation to <ref loc="LUK 1">Luke</ref></char>–Acts for more detailed information on the Gospel of Luke). The six parts of the book of Acts each describe a new phase in the expansion of the Messiah-following movement outward from Jerusalem. These sections are all marked by variations on the phrase the <char style="qt">word of God continued to spread and flourish</char>:</para>
  <para style="ili1">: First, the church is established in Jerusalem and becomes Greek-speaking, allowing it to spread its message throughout the empire.</para>
  <para style="ili1">: Next, the movement expands into the rest of Palestine.</para>
  <para style="ili1">: Third, Gentiles are included in the gathering of Jesus-followers alongside Jews.</para>
  <para style="ili1">: Fourth, messengers are sent west into the Roman province of Asia.</para>
  <para style="ili1">: Fifth, these messengers enter Europe.</para>
  <para style="ili1">: In the sixth and final phase, the movement reaches the capital city of Rome and into the highest levels of society; God’s kingdom is thus announced to all nations.</para>
