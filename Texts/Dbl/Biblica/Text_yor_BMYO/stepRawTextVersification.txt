#
# When running osis2mod, you have to specify the versification scheme to which
# your text conforms (or more or less conforms).
#
# If you are applying reversification, the processing always forces the scheme
# to be NRSV(A), and since you have no choice in the matter, this present file
# is of no interest.
#
# If you are _not_ applying reversification, however, you need to choose one of
# the schemes supported by osis2mod; and you need to choose one which is a good
# fit (to the extent that this is possible), because if osis2mod is presented
# with a text which does not fit the scheme it has been asked to use, it may
# amalgamate verses or even (I think) drop them, which is clearly an undesirable
# situation.
#
# This file contains a ranking of the various osis2mod versification schemes.
# Given that it is comparatively unusual (based upon our experience with
# reversification) to come across an exact fit, you will almost certainly
# need to choose between schemes which do not quite fit.  Rather than simply
# give you a proposal, I include below the internally-generated scores for
# the various schemes.
#
# In general, it is a Bad Thing if osis2mod does not have the books / chapters /
# verses which appear in your text -- much better to opt for a scheme where
# osis2mod contains elements which are _not_ needed than one where it lacks
# elements which _are_ needed.
#
# Hopefully the scoring below will help with the choice.  The options are listed
# best fit first, based upon my (fairly arbitrary) scoring, which is as
# follows :-
#
#   Larger scores are worse.
#
#   0 implies a perfect fit.
#
#   A verse which osis2mod expects, but which is not available in the raw text,
#   scores 1.
#
#   A verse which osis2mod does _not_ expect, but which is present in the raw
#   text, scores 1000.  This reflects my comment above, that osis2mod may
#   amalgamate verses which it is not expecting -- something which is probably
#   undesirable.
#
#   Schemes which are completely infeasible are given a score of 999,999.
#
#   I never evaluate both KJV _and_ KJVA or both NRSV _and_ NRSVA -- in each
#   case I choose one or other from the pair, according to whether the text
#   being handled does or does not have DC books.
