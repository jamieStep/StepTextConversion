This ruler continues to work in people who refuse to obey God. <verse eid="EPH 2:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="EPH 2:3" />All of us once lived among these people, and followed the desires of our corrupt nature. We did what our corrupt desires and thoughts wanted us to do. So, because of our nature, we deserved God’s anger just like everyone else.<verse eid="EPH 2:3" /></para>

In his body he has made Jewish and non-Jewish people one by breaking down the wall of hostility that kept them apart. <verse eid="EPH 2:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="EPH 2:15" />He brought an end to the commandments and demands found in Moses’ Teachings so that he could take Jewish and non-Jewish people and create one new humanity in himself. So he made peace. <verse eid="EPH 2:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="EPH 2:16" />He also brought them back to God in one body by his cross, on which he killed the hostility. <verse eid="EPH 2:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="EPH 2:17" />He came with the Good News of peace for you who were far away and for those who were near. <verse eid="EPH 2:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="EPH 2:18" />So Jewish and non-Jewish people can go to the Father in one Spirit.<verse eid="EPH 2:18" /></para>

God, who created all things, kept it hidden in the past. <verse eid="EPH 3:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="EPH 3:10" />He did this so that now, through the church, he could let the rulers and authorities in heaven know his infinite wisdom. <verse eid="EPH 3:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="EPH 3:11" />This was God’s plan for all of history which he carried out through Christ Jesus our Lord. <verse eid="EPH 3:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="EPH 3:12" />We can go to God with bold confidence through faith in Christ. <verse eid="EPH 3:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="EPH 3:13" />So then, I ask you not to become discouraged by the troubles I suffer for you.

Live as children who have light. <verse eid="EPH 5:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="EPH 5:9" />Light produces everything that is good, that has God’s approval, and that is true. <verse eid="EPH 5:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="EPH 5:10" />Determine which things please the Lord. <verse eid="EPH 5:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="EPH 5:11" />Have nothing to do with the useless works that darkness produces. Instead, expose them for what they are. <verse eid="EPH 5:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="EPH 5:12" />It is shameful to talk about what some people do in secret. <verse eid="EPH 5:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="EPH 5:13" />Light exposes the true character of everything <verse eid="EPH 5:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="EPH 5:14" />because light makes everything easy to see.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="25" style="v" sid="EPH 5:25" />Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave his life for it. <verse eid="EPH 5:25" /><verse number="26" style="v" sid="EPH 5:26" />He did this to make the church holy by cleansing it, washing it using water along with spoken words. <verse eid="EPH 5:26" /><verse number="27" style="v" sid="EPH 5:27" />Then he could present it to himself as a glorious church, without any kind of stain or wrinkle—holy and without faults. <verse eid="EPH 5:27" /><verse number="28" style="v" sid="EPH 5:28" />So husbands must love their wives as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself. <verse eid="EPH 5:28" /><verse number="29" style="v" sid="EPH 5:29" />No one ever hated his own body.

(I’m talking about Christ’s relationship to the church.) <verse eid="EPH 5:32" /><verse number="33" style="v" sid="EPH 5:33" />But every husband must love his wife as he loves himself, and wives should respect their husbands.<verse eid="EPH 5:33" /></para>
