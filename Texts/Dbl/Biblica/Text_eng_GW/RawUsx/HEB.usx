  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="HEB 1:1" />In the past God spoke to our ancestors at many different times and in many different ways through the prophets. <verse eid="HEB 1:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="HEB 1:2" />In these last days he has spoken to us through his Son. God made his Son responsible for everything. His Son is the one through whom God made the universe. <verse eid="HEB 1:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="HEB 1:3" />His Son is the reflection of God’s glory and the exact likeness of God’s being. He holds everything together through his powerful words. After he had cleansed people from their sins, he now holds the honored position—the one next to the majestic God [the Father] on the heavenly throne.<verse eid="HEB 1:3" /></para>

Then we won’t drift away <char style="add">⌞from the truth⌟</char>. <verse eid="HEB 2:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="HEB 2:2" />After all, the message that the angels brought was reliable, and every violation and act of disobedience was properly punished. <verse eid="HEB 2:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="HEB 2:3" />So how will we escape punishment if we reject the important message, the message that God saved us? First, the Lord told this saving message. Then those who heard him confirmed that message. <verse eid="HEB 2:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="HEB 2:4" />God verified what they said through miraculous signs, amazing things, other powerful acts, and with other gifts from the Holy Spirit as he wanted.<verse eid="HEB 2:4" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="HEB 2:5" />He didn’t put the world that will come (about which we are talking) under the angels’ control. <verse eid="HEB 2:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="HEB 2:6" />Instead, someone has declared this somewhere in Scripture:</para>

Therefore, while God was bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was the right time to bring Jesus, the source of their salvation, to the end of his work through suffering.<verse eid="HEB 2:10" /></para>
  <para style="s1">Jesus Became One of Us to Help Us</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="HEB 2:11" />Jesus, who makes people holy, and all those who are made holy have the same Father. That is why Jesus isn’t ashamed to call them brothers and sisters. <verse eid="HEB 2:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="HEB 2:12" />He says,</para>
  <para style="b" vid="HEB 2:12" />
  <para style="q1" vid="HEB 2:12">“I will tell my people about your name.</para>
  <para style="q1" vid="HEB 2:12">I will praise you within the congregation.”<verse eid="HEB 2:12" /></para>
  <para style="b" />
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="HEB 2:13" />In addition, Jesus says,</para>

  <para style="b" vid="HEB 2:13" />

  <para style="b" />
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="HEB 2:14" />Since all of these sons and daughters have flesh and blood, Jesus took on flesh and blood to be like them. He did this so that by dying he would destroy the one who had power over death (that is, the devil). <verse eid="HEB 2:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="HEB 2:15" />In this way he would free those who were slaves all their lives because they were afraid of dying. <verse eid="HEB 2:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="HEB 2:16" />So Jesus helps Abraham’s descendants rather than helping angels. <verse eid="HEB 2:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="HEB 2:17" />Therefore, he had to become like his brothers and sisters so that he could be merciful. He became like them so that he could serve as a faithful chief priest in God’s presence and make peace with God for their sins. <verse eid="HEB 2:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="HEB 2:18" />Because Jesus experienced temptation when he suffered, he is able to help others when they are tempted.<verse eid="HEB 2:18" /></para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="HEB 4:3" />We who believe are entering that place of rest.

Those who heard the Good News in the past did not enter God’s place of rest because they did not obey God. <verse eid="HEB 4:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="HEB 4:7" />So God set another day. That day is today. Many years after <char style="add">⌞your ancestors failed to enter that place of rest⌟</char> God spoke about it through David in the passage already quoted: “If you hear God speak today, don’t be stubborn.” <verse eid="HEB 4:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="HEB 4:8" />If Joshua had given the people rest, God would not have spoken about another day. <verse eid="HEB 4:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="HEB 4:9" />Therefore, a time of eternal rest exists for God’s people. <verse eid="HEB 4:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="HEB 4:10" />Those who entered his place of rest also rest from their work as God did from his.<verse eid="HEB 4:10" /></para>

    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="HEB 13:11" />The chief priest brings the blood of animals into the holy place as an offering for sin. But the bodies of those animals were burned outside the Israelite camp. <verse eid="HEB 13:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="HEB 13:12" />That is why Jesus suffered outside the gates of Jerusalem. He suffered to make the people holy with his own blood. <verse eid="HEB 13:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="HEB 13:13" />So we must go to him outside the camp and endure the insults he endured. <verse eid="HEB 13:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="HEB 13:14" />We don’t have a permanent city here on earth, but we are looking for the city that we will have in the future. <verse eid="HEB 13:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="HEB 13:15" />Through Jesus we should always bring God a sacrifice of praise, that is, words that acknowledge him. <verse eid="HEB 13:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="HEB 13:16" />Don’t forget to do good things for others and to share what you have with them. These are the kinds of sacrifices that please God.<verse eid="HEB 13:16" /></para>
