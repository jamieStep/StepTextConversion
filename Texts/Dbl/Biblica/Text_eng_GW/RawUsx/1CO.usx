    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="1CO 1:10" />Brothers and sisters, I encourage all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to agree with each other and not to split into opposing groups. I want you to be united in your understanding and opinions. <verse eid="1CO 1:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="1CO 1:11" />Brothers and sisters, some people from Chloe’s family have made it clear to me that you are quarreling among yourselves. <verse eid="1CO 1:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="1CO 1:12" />This is what I mean: Each of you is saying, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:12 </char><char style="fk" closed="false">Cephas </char><char style="ft" closed="false">is the Aramaic name for the Apostle Peter.</char></note> or “I follow Christ.” <verse eid="1CO 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="1CO 1:13" />Has Christ been divided?

Beyond that, I’m not sure whether I baptized anyone else. <verse eid="1CO 1:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="1CO 1:17" />Christ didn’t send me to baptize. Instead, he sent me to spread the Good News. I didn’t use intellectual arguments. That would have made the cross of Christ lose its meaning.<verse eid="1CO 1:17" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" sid="1CO 1:18" />The message about the cross is nonsense to those who are being destroyed, but it is God’s power to us who are being saved. <verse eid="1CO 1:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="1CO 1:19" />Scripture says,</para>

    <verse number="20" style="v" sid="1CO 1:20" />Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the persuasive speaker of our time? Hasn’t God turned the wisdom of the world into nonsense? <verse eid="1CO 1:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="1CO 1:21" />The world with its wisdom was unable to recognize God in terms of his own wisdom. So God decided to use the nonsense of the Good News we speak to save those who believe. <verse eid="1CO 1:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="1CO 1:22" />Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks look for wisdom, <verse eid="1CO 1:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="1CO 1:23" />but our message is that Christ was crucified. This offends Jewish people and makes no sense to people who are not Jewish. <verse eid="1CO 1:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="1CO 1:24" />But to those Jews and Greeks who are called, he is Christ, God’s power and God’s wisdom. <verse eid="1CO 1:24" /><verse number="25" style="v" sid="1CO 1:25" />God’s nonsense is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.<verse eid="1CO 1:25" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" sid="1CO 1:26" />Brothers and sisters, consider what you were when God called you to be Christians. Not many of you were wise from a human point of view. You were not in powerful positions or in the upper social classes. <verse eid="1CO 1:26" /><verse number="27" style="v" sid="1CO 1:27" />But God chose what the world considers nonsense to put wise people to shame. God chose what the world considers weak to put what is strong to shame. <verse eid="1CO 1:27" /><verse number="28" style="v" sid="1CO 1:28" />God chose what the world considers ordinary and what it despises—what it considers to be nothing—in order to destroy what it considers to be something. <verse eid="1CO 1:28" /><verse number="29" style="v" sid="1CO 1:29" />As a result, no one can brag in God’s presence. <verse eid="1CO 1:29" /><verse number="30" style="v" sid="1CO 1:30" />You are partners with Christ Jesus because of God. Jesus has become our wisdom sent from God, our approval, our holiness, and our ransom from sin. <verse eid="1CO 1:30" /><verse number="31" style="v" sid="1CO 1:31" />As Scripture says, “Whoever brags must brag about what the Lord has done.”<verse eid="1CO 1:31" /></para>

I was afraid and very nervous. <verse eid="1CO 2:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="1CO 2:4" />I didn’t speak my message with persuasive intellectual arguments. I spoke my message with a show of spiritual power <verse eid="1CO 2:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="1CO 2:5" />so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on God’s power.<verse eid="1CO 2:5" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="1CO 2:6" />However, we do use wisdom to speak to those who are mature. It is a wisdom that doesn’t belong to this world or to the rulers of this world who are in power today and gone tomorrow. <verse eid="1CO 2:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="1CO 2:7" />We speak about the mystery of God’s wisdom. It is a wisdom that has been hidden, which God had planned for our glory before the world began. <verse eid="1CO 2:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="1CO 2:8" />Not one of the rulers of this world has known it. If they had, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory. <verse eid="1CO 2:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="1CO 2:9" />But as Scripture says:</para>

  <para style="m">
    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="1CO 2:10" />God has revealed those things to us by his Spirit. The Spirit searches everything, especially the deep things of God. <verse eid="1CO 2:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="1CO 2:11" />After all, who knows everything about a person except that person’s own spirit? In the same way, no one has known everything about God except God’s Spirit. <verse eid="1CO 2:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="1CO 2:12" />Now, we didn’t receive the spirit that belongs to the world. Instead, we received the Spirit who comes from God so that we could know the things which God has freely given us. <verse eid="1CO 2:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="1CO 2:13" />We don’t speak about these things using teachings that are based on intellectual arguments like people do.

    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="1CO 2:14" />A person who isn’t spiritual doesn’t accept the teachings of God’s Spirit. He thinks they’re nonsense. He can’t understand them because a person must be spiritual to evaluate them. <verse eid="1CO 2:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="1CO 2:15" />Spiritual people evaluate everything but are subject to no one’s evaluation.<verse eid="1CO 2:15" /></para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="1CO 3:1" />Brothers and sisters, I couldn’t talk to you as spiritual people but as people still influenced by your corrupt nature. You were infants in your faith in Christ. <verse eid="1CO 3:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="1CO 3:2" />I gave you milk to drink. I didn’t give you solid food because you weren’t ready for it.

However, someone else is building on it. Each person must be careful how he builds on it. <verse eid="1CO 3:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="1CO 3:11" />After all, no one can lay any other foundation than the one that is already laid, and that foundation is Jesus Christ. <verse eid="1CO 3:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="1CO 3:12" />People may build on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw. <verse eid="1CO 3:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="1CO 3:13" />The day will make what each one does clearly visible because fire will reveal it. That fire will determine what kind of work each person has done. <verse eid="1CO 3:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="1CO 3:14" />If what a person has built survives, he will receive a reward. <verse eid="1CO 3:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="1CO 3:15" />If his work is burned up, he will suffer <char style="add">⌞the loss⌟</char>.
