  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="LUK 1:1" />Many have attempted to write about what had taken place among us. <verse eid="LUK 1:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="LUK 1:2" />They received their information from those who had been eyewitnesses and servants of God’s word from the beginning, and they passed it on to us. <verse eid="LUK 1:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="LUK 1:3" />I, too, have followed everything closely from the beginning. So I thought it would be a good idea to write an orderly account for Your Excellency, Theophilus. <verse eid="LUK 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="LUK 1:4" />In this way you will know that what you’ve been told is true.<verse eid="LUK 1:4" /></para>

  <para style="m">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="LUK 1:5" />When Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the division of priests named after Abijah. Zechariah’s wife Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron. <verse eid="LUK 1:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="LUK 1:6" />Zechariah and Elizabeth had God’s approval. They followed all the Lord’s commands and regulations perfectly. <verse eid="LUK 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="LUK 1:7" />Yet, they never had any children because Elizabeth couldn’t become pregnant. Both of them were too old to have children.<verse eid="LUK 1:7" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" sid="LUK 1:8" />Zechariah was on duty with his division of priests. As he served in God’s presence, <verse eid="LUK 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="LUK 1:9" />he was chosen by priestly custom to go into the Lord’s temple to burn incense. <verse eid="LUK 1:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="LUK 1:10" />All the people were praying outside while he was burning incense.<verse eid="LUK 1:10" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="LUK 1:11" />Then, to the right of the incense altar, an angel of the Lord appeared to him. <verse eid="LUK 1:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="LUK 1:12" />Zechariah was troubled and overcome with fear.<verse eid="LUK 1:12" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="LUK 1:13" />The angel said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayer. Your wife Elizabeth will have a son, and you will name him John. <verse eid="LUK 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="LUK 1:14" />He will be your pride and joy, and many people will be glad that he was born. <verse eid="LUK 1:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="LUK 1:15" />As far as the Lord is concerned, he will be a great man. He will never drink wine or any other liquor. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born. <verse eid="LUK 1:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="LUK 1:16" />He will bring many people in Israel back to the Lord their God. <verse eid="LUK 1:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="LUK 1:17" />He will go ahead of the Lord with the spirit and power that Elijah had. He will change parents’ attitudes toward their children. He will change disobedient people so that they will accept the wisdom of those who have God’s approval. In this way he will prepare the people for their Lord.”<verse eid="LUK 1:17" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" sid="LUK 1:18" />Zechariah said to the angel, “What proof is there for this? I’m an old man, and my wife is beyond her childbearing years.”<verse eid="LUK 1:18" /></para>

Everything will come true at the right time.”<verse eid="LUK 1:20" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" sid="LUK 1:21" />Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah. They were amazed that he was staying in the temple so long. <verse eid="LUK 1:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="LUK 1:22" />When he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. So they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. He motioned to them but remained unable to talk.<verse eid="LUK 1:22" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" sid="LUK 1:23" />When the days of his service were over, he went home. <verse eid="LUK 1:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="LUK 1:24" />Later, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and didn’t go out in public for five months. She said, <verse eid="LUK 1:24" /><verse number="25" style="v" sid="LUK 1:25" />“The Lord has done this for me now. He has removed my public disgrace.”<verse eid="LUK 1:25" /></para>
