    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="DEU 1:6" />At Mount Horeb the <char style="nd">Lord</char> our God said to us, “You have stayed at this mountain long enough. <verse eid="DEU 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="DEU 1:7" />Break camp, and get ready! Go to the mountain region of the Amorites, and go to everyone living on the plains, in the mountains, in the foothills, in the Negev, on the whole Mediterranean coast (the land of the Canaanites), and into Lebanon as far as the Euphrates River. <verse eid="DEU 1:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="DEU 1:8" />I’m giving you this land.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="DEU 1:15" />So I took the heads of your tribes who were wise and experienced men and made them officers for each of your tribes.

    <verse number="19" style="v" sid="DEU 1:19" />So we left Mount Horeb, as the <char style="nd">Lord</char> our God had commanded.

At last we came to Kadesh Barnea. <verse eid="DEU 1:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="DEU 1:20" />Then I said to you, “We have come to the mountain region of the Amorites, which the <char style="nd">Lord</char> our God is giving us. <verse eid="DEU 1:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="DEU 1:21" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God is giving you this land.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" sid="DEU 1:23" />It seemed like a good idea to me. So I chose 12 of your men, one from each tribe. <verse eid="DEU 1:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="DEU 1:24" />They left and went into the mountains. When they came to the Eshcol Valley, they explored it. <verse eid="DEU 1:24" /><verse number="25" style="v" sid="DEU 1:25" />They took some of the region’s fruit with them and brought it back to us.

That’s why he brought us out of Egypt. He wanted to hand us over to the Amorites so that they could destroy us! <verse eid="DEU 1:27" /><verse number="28" style="v" sid="DEU 1:28" />Where are we going anyway? Our own men have discouraged us by saying, ‘The people there are taller and stronger than we are. The cities are big with sky-high walls! We even saw the people of Anak there.’ ”<verse eid="DEU 1:28" /></para>
  <para style="p">

He carried you wherever you went until you came to this place.<verse eid="DEU 1:31" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="32" style="v" sid="DEU 1:32" />In spite of this, you didn’t trust the <char style="nd">Lord</char> your God, <verse eid="DEU 1:32" /><verse number="33" style="v" sid="DEU 1:33" />who went ahead of you to find places for you to camp.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="34" style="v" sid="DEU 1:34" />When the <char style="nd">Lord</char> heard what you said, he was angry and took this oath: <verse eid="DEU 1:34" /><verse number="35" style="v" sid="DEU 1:35" />“Not one of these evil people will ever see the good land that I swore to give to your ancestors, <verse eid="DEU 1:35" /><verse number="36" style="v" sid="DEU 1:36" />except Caleb, son of Jephunneh.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="37" style="v" sid="DEU 1:37" />The <char style="nd">Lord</char> became angry with me because of you.

Encourage him, because he will help Israel take possession of the land. <verse eid="DEU 1:38" /><verse number="39" style="v" sid="DEU 1:39" />Although you thought the little children would be captured in war, your children, who are still too young to know the difference between good and evil, will enter that land. I will give it to them, and they will take possession of it. <verse eid="DEU 1:39" /><verse number="40" style="v" sid="DEU 1:40" />Turn around, go back into the desert, and follow the road that goes to the Red Sea.”<verse eid="DEU 1:40" /></para>
  <para style="p">

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="43" style="v" sid="DEU 1:43" />I told you, but you wouldn’t listen.
