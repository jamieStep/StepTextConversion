    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="JDG 2:1" />The Messenger of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> went from Gilgal to Bochim.

  <para style="m">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="JDG 2:11" />The people of Israel did what the <char style="nd">Lord</char> considered evil. They began to serve other gods—the Baals. <verse eid="JDG 2:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="JDG 2:12" />The Israelites abandoned the <char style="nd">Lord</char> God of their ancestors, the God who brought them out of Egypt. They followed the other gods of the people around them. They worshiped these gods, and that made the <char style="nd">Lord</char> angry. <verse eid="JDG 2:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="JDG 2:13" />They abandoned the <char style="nd">Lord</char> to serve the god Baal and the goddess Astarte. <verse eid="JDG 2:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="JDG 2:14" />So the <char style="nd">Lord</char> became angry with the people of Israel. He handed them over to people who robbed them. He also used their enemies around them to defeat them. They could no longer stand up against their enemies. <verse eid="JDG 2:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="JDG 2:15" />Whenever the Israelites went to war, the power of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> brought disaster on them.

They refused to be like their ancestors. <verse eid="JDG 2:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="JDG 2:18" />But when the <char style="nd">Lord</char> appointed judges for the Israelites, he was with each judge. The <char style="nd">Lord</char> rescued them from their enemies as long as that judge was alive. The <char style="nd">Lord</char> was moved by the groaning of those who were tormented and oppressed. <verse eid="JDG 2:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="JDG 2:19" />But after each judge died, the people went back to their old ways and acted more corruptly than their parents.
