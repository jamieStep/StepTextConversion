They are confusing you. They want to distort the Good News about Christ. <verse eid="GAL 1:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="GAL 1:8" />Whoever tells you good news that is different from the Good News we gave you should be condemned to hell, even if he is one of us or an angel from heaven. <verse eid="GAL 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="GAL 1:9" />I’m now telling you again what we’ve told you in the past: If anyone tells you good news that is different from the Good News you received, that person should be condemned to hell.<verse eid="GAL 1:9" /></para>

    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="GAL 1:10" />Am I saying this now to win the approval of people or God? Am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be Christ’s servant.<verse eid="GAL 1:10" /></para>

  <para style="m">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="GAL 1:11" />I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the Good News I have spread is not a human message. <verse eid="GAL 1:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="GAL 1:12" />I didn’t receive it from any person. I wasn’t taught it, but Jesus Christ revealed it to me.<verse eid="GAL 1:12" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="GAL 1:13" />You heard about the way I once lived when I followed the Jewish religion. You heard how I violently persecuted God’s church and tried to destroy it. <verse eid="GAL 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="GAL 1:14" />You also heard how I was far ahead of other Jews in my age group in following the Jewish religion. I had become that fanatical for the traditions of my ancestors.<verse eid="GAL 1:14" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="GAL 1:15" />But God, who appointed me before I was born and who called me by his kindness, was pleased <verse eid="GAL 1:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="GAL 1:16" />to show me his Son. He did this so that I would tell people who are not Jewish that his Son is the Good News. When this happened, I didn’t talk it over with any other person. <verse eid="GAL 1:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="GAL 1:17" />I didn’t even go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went to Arabia and then came back to Damascus.<verse eid="GAL 1:17" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" sid="GAL 1:18" />Then, three years later I went to Jerusalem to become personally acquainted with Cephas.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:18 </char><char style="fk" closed="false">Cephas </char><char style="ft" closed="false">is the Aramaic name for the apostle Peter.</char></note> I stayed with him for fifteen days. <verse eid="GAL 1:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="GAL 1:19" />I didn’t see any other apostle. I only saw James, the Lord’s brother. <verse eid="GAL 1:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="GAL 1:20" />(God is my witness that what I’m writing is not a lie.) <verse eid="GAL 1:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="GAL 1:21" />Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. <verse eid="GAL 1:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="GAL 1:22" />The churches of Christ in Judea didn’t know me personally. <verse eid="GAL 1:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="GAL 1:23" />The only thing they had heard was this: “The man who persecuted us is now spreading the faith that he once tried to destroy.” <verse eid="GAL 1:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="GAL 1:24" />So they praised God for what had happened to me.<verse eid="GAL 1:24" /></para>

  <para style="s1">Paul Was Accepted as an Apostle by the Leaders in Jerusalem</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="GAL 2:1" />Then 14 years later I went to Jerusalem again with Barnabas. I also took Titus along. <verse eid="GAL 2:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="GAL 2:2" />I went in response to a revelation <char style="add">⌞from God⌟</char>. I showed them the way I spread the Good News among people who are not Jewish. I did this in a private meeting with those recognized as important people to see whether all my efforts had been wasted.<verse eid="GAL 2:2" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="GAL 2:3" />Titus was with me, and although he is Greek, no one forced him to be circumcised.<verse eid="GAL 2:3" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" sid="GAL 2:4" />False Christians were brought in. They slipped in as spies to learn about the freedom Christ Jesus gives us. They hoped to find a way to control us. <verse eid="GAL 2:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="GAL 2:5" />But we did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the Good News would always be yours.<verse eid="GAL 2:5" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="GAL 2:6" />Those who were recognized as important people didn’t add a single thing to my message. (What sort of people they were makes no difference to me, since God doesn’t play favorites.) <verse eid="GAL 2:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="GAL 2:7" />In fact, they saw that I had been entrusted with telling the Good News to people who are not circumcised as Peter had been entrusted to tell it to those who are circumcised. <verse eid="GAL 2:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="GAL 2:8" />The one who made Peter an apostle to Jewish people also made me an apostle to people who are not Jewish. <verse eid="GAL 2:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="GAL 2:9" />James, Cephas, and John (who were recognized as the most important people) acknowledged that God had given me this special gift.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:9 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">“had given me grace.”</char></note> So they shook hands with Barnabas and me, agreeing to be our partners. It was understood that we would work among the people who are not Jewish and they would work among Jewish people. <verse eid="GAL 2:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="GAL 2:10" />The only thing they asked us to do was to remember the poor, the very thing which I was eager to do.<verse eid="GAL 2:10" /></para>
  <para style="s1">Paul Shows How Cephas Was Wrong</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="GAL 2:11" />When Cephas came to Antioch, I had to openly oppose him because he was completely wrong. <verse eid="GAL 2:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="GAL 2:12" />He ate with people who were not Jewish until some men James had sent <char style="add">⌞from Jerusalem⌟</char> arrived. Then Cephas drew back and would not associate with people who were not Jewish. He was afraid of those who insisted that circumcision was necessary. <verse eid="GAL 2:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="GAL 2:13" />The other Jewish Christians also joined him in this hypocrisy. Even Barnabas was swept along with them.<verse eid="GAL 2:13" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="GAL 2:14" />But I saw that they were not properly following the truth of the Good News. So I told Cephas in front of everyone, “You’re Jewish, but you live like a person who is not Jewish. So how can you insist that people who are not Jewish must live like Jews?”<verse eid="GAL 2:14" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="GAL 2:15" />We are Jewish by birth, not sinners from other nations. <verse eid="GAL 2:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="GAL 2:16" />Yet, we know that people don’t receive God’s approval by any effort to follow the laws in the Scriptures, but only by believing in Jesus Christ. So we also believed in Jesus Christ in order to receive God’s approval by faith in Christ and not by our own efforts. People won’t receive God’s approval by their own efforts.<verse eid="GAL 2:16" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="GAL 2:17" />If we, the same people who are searching for God’s approval in Christ, are still sinners, does that mean that Christ encourages us to sin? That’s unthinkable! <verse eid="GAL 2:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="GAL 2:18" />If I rebuild something that I’ve torn down, I admit that I was wrong to tear it down. <verse eid="GAL 2:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="GAL 2:19" />When I tried to obey the laws in the Scriptures, those laws killed me. As a result, I live in a relationship with God. I have been crucified with Christ. <verse eid="GAL 2:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="GAL 2:20" />I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live I live by believing in God’s Son, who loved me and took the punishment for my sins. <verse eid="GAL 2:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="GAL 2:21" />I don’t reject God’s kindness.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:21 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">“grace.”</char></note> If we receive God’s approval by obeying the laws in the Scriptures, then Christ’s death was pointless.<verse eid="GAL 2:21" /></para>

  <para style="s1">God Approves of Those Who Believe</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="GAL 3:1" />You stupid people of Galatia! Who put you under an evil spell? Wasn’t Christ Jesus’ crucifixion clearly described to you? <verse eid="GAL 3:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="GAL 3:2" />I want to learn only one thing from you. Did you receive the Spirit by your own efforts to follow the laws in the Scriptures or by believing what you heard? <verse eid="GAL 3:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="GAL 3:3" />Are you that stupid? Did you begin in a spiritual way only to end up doing things in a human way? <verse eid="GAL 3:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="GAL 3:4" />Did you suffer so much for nothing? <char style="add">⌞I doubt⌟</char> that it was for nothing! <verse eid="GAL 3:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="GAL 3:5" />Does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you through your own efforts or through believing what you heard?<verse eid="GAL 3:5" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="GAL 3:6" />Abraham serves as an example. He believed God, and that faith was regarded as the basis of Abraham’s approval by God. <verse eid="GAL 3:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="GAL 3:7" />You must understand that people who have faith are Abraham’s descendants. <verse eid="GAL 3:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="GAL 3:8" />Scripture saw ahead of time that God would give his approval to non-Jewish people who have faith. So Scripture announced the Good News to Abraham ahead of time when it said, “Through you all the people of the world will be blessed.” <verse eid="GAL 3:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="GAL 3:9" />So people who believe are blessed together with Abraham, the man of faith.<verse eid="GAL 3:9" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="GAL 3:10" />Certainly, there is a curse on all who rely on their own efforts because Scripture says, “Whoever doesn’t obey everything that is written in Moses’ Teachings is cursed.” <verse eid="GAL 3:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="GAL 3:11" />No one receives God’s approval by obeying the laws in Moses’ Teachings since, “The person who has God’s approval will live by faith.” <verse eid="GAL 3:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="GAL 3:12" />These laws have nothing to do with faith, but, “Whoever obeys laws will live because he obeys them.”<verse eid="GAL 3:12" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="GAL 3:13" />Christ paid the price to free us from the curse that the laws in Moses’ Teachings bring by becoming cursed instead of us. Scripture says, “Everyone who is hung on a tree is cursed.” <verse eid="GAL 3:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="GAL 3:14" /><char style="add">⌞Christ paid the price⌟</char> so that the blessing promised to Abraham would come to all the people of the world through Jesus Christ and we would receive the promised Spirit through faith.<verse eid="GAL 3:14" /></para>
  <para style="s1">The Relationship between Law and Promise</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="GAL 3:15" />Brothers and sisters, let me use an example from everyday life. No one can cancel a person’s will or add conditions to it once that will is put into effect. <verse eid="GAL 3:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="GAL 3:16" />The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. Scripture doesn’t say, “descendants,” referring to many, but “your descendant,” referring to one. That descendant is Christ. <verse eid="GAL 3:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="GAL 3:17" />This is what I mean: The laws <char style="add">⌞given to Moses⌟</char> 430 years after God had already put his promise <char style="add">⌞to Abraham⌟</char> into effect didn’t cancel the promise <char style="add">⌞to Abraham⌟</char>. <verse eid="GAL 3:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="GAL 3:18" />If we have to gain the inheritance by following those laws, then it no longer comes to us because of the promise. However, God freely gave the inheritance to Abraham through a promise.<verse eid="GAL 3:18" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" sid="GAL 3:19" />What, then, is the purpose of the laws given to Moses? They were added to identify what wrongdoing is. Moses’ laws did this until the descendant to whom the promise was given came.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:19 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">“Moses’ laws did this until the descendant referred to in the promise ⌞to Abraham⌟ came.”</char></note> It was put into effect through angels, using a mediator. <verse eid="GAL 3:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="GAL 3:20" />A mediator is not used when there is only one person involved, and God has acted on his own.<verse eid="GAL 3:20" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" sid="GAL 3:21" />Does this mean, then, that the laws given to Moses contradict God’s promises? That’s unthinkable! If those laws could give us life, then certainly we would receive God’s approval because we obeyed them. <verse eid="GAL 3:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="GAL 3:22" />But Scripture states that the whole world is controlled by the power of sin. Therefore, a promise based on faith in Jesus Christ could be given to those who believe.<verse eid="GAL 3:22" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" sid="GAL 3:23" />We were kept under control by Moses’ laws until this faith came. We were under their control until this faith which was about to come would be revealed.<verse eid="GAL 3:23" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="24" style="v" sid="GAL 3:24" />Before Christ came, Moses’ laws served as our guardian. Christ came so that we could receive God’s approval by faith. <verse eid="GAL 3:24" /><verse number="25" style="v" sid="GAL 3:25" />But now that this faith has come, we are no longer under the control of a guardian. <verse eid="GAL 3:25" /><verse number="26" style="v" sid="GAL 3:26" />You are all God’s children by believing in Christ Jesus. <verse eid="GAL 3:26" /><verse number="27" style="v" sid="GAL 3:27" />Clearly, all of you who were baptized in Christ’s name have clothed yourselves with Christ. <verse eid="GAL 3:27" /><verse number="28" style="v" sid="GAL 3:28" />There are neither Jews nor Greeks, slaves nor free people, males nor females. You are all the same in Christ Jesus. <verse eid="GAL 3:28" /><verse number="29" style="v" sid="GAL 3:29" />If you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants and heirs, as God promised.<verse eid="GAL 3:29" /></para>
  <chapter eid="GAL 3" />
  <chapter number="4" style="c" sid="GAL 4" />
  <para style="s1">You Are God’s Children</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="GAL 4:1" />Let me explain further. As long as an heir is a child, he is no better off than a slave, even though he owns everything. <verse eid="GAL 4:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="GAL 4:2" />He is placed under the control of guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. <verse eid="GAL 4:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="GAL 4:3" />It was the same way with us. When we were children, we were slaves to the principles of this world. <verse eid="GAL 4:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="GAL 4:4" />But when the right time came, God sent his Son <char style="add">⌞into the world⌟</char>. A woman gave birth to him, and he came under the control of the laws given to Moses. <verse eid="GAL 4:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="GAL 4:5" />God sent him to pay for the freedom of those who were controlled by these laws so that we would be adopted as his children. <verse eid="GAL 4:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="GAL 4:6" />Because you are God’s children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into us to call out, “Abba! <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">4:6 </char><char style="fq" closed="false">Abba </char><char style="ft" closed="false">is Aramaic for “father.”</char></note> Father!” <verse eid="GAL 4:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="GAL 4:7" />So you are no longer slaves but God’s children. Since you are God’s children, God has also made you heirs.<verse eid="GAL 4:7" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" sid="GAL 4:8" />When you didn’t know God, you were slaves to things which are really not gods at all. <verse eid="GAL 4:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="GAL 4:9" />But now you know God, or rather, God knows you. So how can you turn back again to the powerless and bankrupt principles of this world? Why do you want to become their slaves all over again? <verse eid="GAL 4:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="GAL 4:10" />You religiously observe days, months, seasons, and years! <verse eid="GAL 4:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="GAL 4:11" />I’m afraid for you.
