  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="EST 1:1" />In the days of Xerxes the following events took place. This was the same Xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Sudan. <verse eid="EST 1:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="EST 1:2" />At the time when King Xerxes sat on the royal throne in the fortress of Susa, <verse eid="EST 1:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="EST 1:3" />he held a banquet in the third year of his reign. The banquet was for all his officials and advisers, that is, the military officers of the Persians and Medes, the nobles and officials of the provinces who had access to him. <verse eid="EST 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="EST 1:4" />He showed them the enormous wealth of his kingdom and the costly splendor of his greatness for many days, 180 to be exact. <verse eid="EST 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="EST 1:5" />When those days were over, the king held a banquet lasting seven days. This banquet was held in the enclosed garden of the king’s palace for all people in the fortress of Susa, whatever their rank.<verse eid="EST 1:5" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="EST 1:6" />The garden had white and violet linen curtains. These curtains were attached to silver rods and marble pillars by cords made of white and purple fine linen. Gold and silver couches were on a mosaic pavement of purple rock, white marble, pearl-like stone, and black marble. <verse eid="EST 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="EST 1:7" />People drank from golden cups. No two cups were alike. The king also provided plenty of royal wine out of his royal generosity. <verse eid="EST 1:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="EST 1:8" />The drinking followed this rule: Drink as you please. (The king had ordered all the waiters in his palace to let everyone do as he pleased.)<verse eid="EST 1:8" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" sid="EST 1:9" />Queen Vashti also held a banquet for the women at the royal palace of King Xerxes.<verse eid="EST 1:9" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="EST 1:10" />On the seventh day when the king was drunk on wine, he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who served under King Xerxes, <verse eid="EST 1:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="EST 1:11" />to bring Queen Vashti in front of the king, wearing her royal crown. He wanted to show the people, especially the officials, her beauty, because she was very attractive. <verse eid="EST 1:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="EST 1:12" />But Queen Vashti refused the king’s command that the eunuchs delivered to her. As a result, the king became very angry, and his rage burned inside him.<verse eid="EST 1:12" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="EST 1:13" />Now, the king usually asked for advice from all the experts in royal decrees and decisions, <verse eid="EST 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="EST 1:14" />from those closest to him—Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These seven officials of the Persians and Medes had access to the king and held the highest rank in the kingdom. The king asked these wise men who knew the times,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">1:14 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">The first part of verse 13 (in Hebrew) has been placed just before verse 15 to express the complex Hebrew sentence structure more clearly in English.</char></note> <verse eid="EST 1:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="EST 1:15" />“According to the royal decrees, what must we do with Queen Vashti since she did not obey King Xerxes’ command, which the eunuchs delivered?”<verse eid="EST 1:15" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" sid="EST 1:16" />Then Memucan spoke up in the presence of the king and the officials, “Queen Vashti has done wrong, not only against the king but also against all the officials and all the people in every province of King Xerxes. <verse eid="EST 1:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="EST 1:17" />The news of what the queen has done will spread to all women, and they will despise their husbands. They will say, ‘King Xerxes ordered Queen Vashti to be brought to him, but she would not come.’ <verse eid="EST 1:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="EST 1:18" />Today the wives of the officials in Persia and Media who have heard what the queen did will talk back to all the king’s officials. There will be contempt and short tempers. <verse eid="EST 1:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="EST 1:19" />If it pleases you, Your Majesty, issue a royal decree. It should be recorded in the decrees of the Persians and Medes, never to be repealed, that Vashti may never again appear in front of King Xerxes. Furthermore, Your Majesty, you should give her royal position to another woman who is more worthy than she. <verse eid="EST 1:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="EST 1:20" />When you issue your decree, your whole kingdom, great as it is, will hear it. Then all the wives will honor their husbands, regardless of their status.”<verse eid="EST 1:20" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" sid="EST 1:21" />The king and his officials approved of this, and so the king did as Memucan suggested. <verse eid="EST 1:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="EST 1:22" />He sent official documents to all the king’s provinces, to each province in its own script and to the people in each province in their own language: “Let every husband be the ruler in his own house and speak with authority.”<verse eid="EST 1:22" /></para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="EST 2:1" />Later, when King Xerxes got over his raging anger, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decided against her.<verse eid="EST 2:1" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="2" style="v" sid="EST 2:2" />So the king’s personal staff said to him, “Search for attractive young virgins for the king. <verse eid="EST 2:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="EST 2:3" />And appoint scouts in all the provinces of your kingdom to gather all the attractive young virgins and bring them to the fortress of Susa, to the women’s quarters. There, in the care of the king’s eunuch Hegai, the guardian of the women, they will have their beauty treatment. <verse eid="EST 2:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="EST 2:4" />Then the young woman who pleases you, Your Majesty, will become queen instead of Vashti.”</para>
  <para style="p" vid="EST 2:4">The king liked the suggestion, and so he did just that.<verse eid="EST 2:4" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="EST 2:5" />In the fortress of Susa there was a Jew from the tribe of Benjamin named Mordecai. He was the son of Jair, the grandson of Shimei, and the great-grandson of Kish. <verse eid="EST 2:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="EST 2:6" />(Kish had been taken captive from Jerusalem together with the others who had gone into exile along with Judah’s King Jehoiakin,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">2:6 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Masoretic Text </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">“Jeconiah,” </char><char style="ft" closed="false">an alternate form of Jehoiakin.</char></note> whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had carried away.) <verse eid="EST 2:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="EST 2:7" />Mordecai had raised Hadassah, also known as Esther, his uncle’s daughter, because she was an orphan. The young woman had a beautiful figure and was very attractive. When her father and mother died, Mordecai adopted her as his own daughter.<verse eid="EST 2:7" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" sid="EST 2:8" />When the king’s announcement and decree were heard, many young women were gathered together and brought to the fortress of Susa. They were placed in the care of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the king’s palace and placed in the care of Hegai, the guardian of the women. <verse eid="EST 2:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="EST 2:9" />The young woman pleased him and won his affection. So he immediately provided her with the beauty treatment, a daily supply of food, and seven suitable female servants from the king’s palace. Then he moved her and her servants to the best place in the women’s quarters.<verse eid="EST 2:9" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="EST 2:10" />Esther did not reveal her nationality or her family background, because Mordecai had ordered her not to. <verse eid="EST 2:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="EST 2:11" />Every day Mordecai would walk back and forth in front of the courtyard of the women’s quarters to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.<verse eid="EST 2:11" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="EST 2:12" />Each young woman had her turn to go to King Xerxes after she had completed the required 12-month treatment for women. The time of beauty treatment was spent as follows: six months using oil of myrrh and six months using perfumes and other treatments for women.<verse eid="EST 2:12" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="EST 2:13" />After that, the young woman would go to the king. Anything she wanted to take with her from the women’s quarters to the king’s palace was given to her. <verse eid="EST 2:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="EST 2:14" />She would go in the evening and come back in the morning to the other quarters for women.

  <para style="p" vid="EST 2:15">When Esther’s turn came to go to the king, she asked only for what the king’s eunuch Hegai, the guardian of the women, advised. Everyone who saw Esther liked her. <verse eid="EST 2:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="EST 2:16" />So Esther was taken to King Xerxes in his royal palace in the month of Tebeth, the tenth month, in the seventh year of his reign.<verse eid="EST 2:16" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="EST 2:17" />Now, the king loved Esther more than all the other women and favored her over all the other virgins. So he put the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti. <verse eid="EST 2:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="EST 2:18" />Then the king held a great banquet for Esther. He invited all his officials and his advisers. He also declared that day a holiday in the provinces, and he handed out gifts from his royal generosity.<verse eid="EST 2:18" /></para>

Esther always did whatever Mordecai told her, as she did when she was a child.<verse eid="EST 2:20" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" sid="EST 2:21" />In those days, while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the entrance, became angry and planned to kill King Xerxes. <verse eid="EST 2:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="EST 2:22" />But Mordecai found out about it and informed Queen Esther. Then Esther told the king, on behalf of Mordecai. <verse eid="EST 2:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="EST 2:23" />When the report was investigated and found to be true, the dead bodies of Bigthan and Teresh were hung on a pole.

  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="EST 3:1" />Later, King Xerxes promoted Haman. (Haman was the son of Hammedatha and was from Agag.) He gave Haman a position higher in authority than all the other officials who were with him. <verse eid="EST 3:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="EST 3:2" />All the king’s advisers were at the king’s gate, kneeling and bowing to Haman with their faces touching the ground, because the king had commanded it. But Mordecai would not kneel and bow to him.<verse eid="EST 3:2" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="EST 3:3" />Then the king’s advisers at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why do you ignore the king’s command?” <verse eid="EST 3:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="EST 3:4" />Although they asked him day after day, he paid no attention to them. So they informed Haman to see if Mordecai’s actions would be tolerated, since Mordecai had told them that he was a Jew.<verse eid="EST 3:4" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="EST 3:5" />When Haman saw that Mordecai did not kneel and bow to him, Haman was infuriated. <verse eid="EST 3:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="EST 3:6" />Because the king’s advisers had informed him about Mordecai’s nationality, he thought it beneath himself to kill only Mordecai. So Haman planned to wipe out Mordecai’s people—all the Jews in the entire kingdom of Xerxes.<verse eid="EST 3:6" /></para>

    <verse number="26" style="v" sid="EST 9:26" />So the Jews called these days Purim, based on the word <char style="tl">Pur</char>.
