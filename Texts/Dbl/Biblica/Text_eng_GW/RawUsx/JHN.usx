Yet, the world didn’t recognize him. <verse eid="JHN 1:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="JHN 1:11" />He went to his own people, and his own people didn’t accept him. <verse eid="JHN 1:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="JHN 1:12" />However, he gave the right to become God’s children to everyone who believed in him. <verse eid="JHN 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="JHN 1:13" />These people didn’t become God’s children in a physical way—from a human impulse or from a husband’s desire <char style="add">⌞to have a child⌟</char>.
