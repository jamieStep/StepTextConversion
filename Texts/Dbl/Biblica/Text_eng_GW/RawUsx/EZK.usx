    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="EZK 1:1" />On the fifth day of the fourth month in the thirtieth year, while I was living among the exiles by the Chebar River, the sky opened, and I saw visions from God. <verse eid="EZK 1:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="EZK 1:2" />On the fifth day of the month, during the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiakin, <verse eid="EZK 1:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="EZK 1:3" />the <char style="nd">Lord</char> spoke his word to the priest Ezekiel, son of Buzi, in Babylon by the Chebar River.

    <verse number="4" style="v" sid="EZK 1:4" />As I looked, I saw a storm coming from the north. There was an immense cloud with flashing lightning surrounded by a bright light. The middle of the lightning looked like glowing metal. <verse eid="EZK 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="EZK 1:5" />In the center of the cloud I saw what looked like four living creatures. They were shaped like humans, <verse eid="EZK 1:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="EZK 1:6" />but each of them had four faces and four wings. <verse eid="EZK 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="EZK 1:7" />Their legs were straight, their feet were like those of calves, and they glittered like polished bronze. <verse eid="EZK 1:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="EZK 1:8" />They had human hands under their wings on each of their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings. <verse eid="EZK 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="EZK 1:9" />Their wings touched each other. The creatures went straight ahead, and they did not turn as they moved.<verse eid="EZK 1:9" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="EZK 1:10" />Their faces looked like this: From the front, each creature had the face of a human. From the right, each one had the face of a lion. From the left, each one had the face of a bull. And from the back, each one had the face of an eagle. <verse eid="EZK 1:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="EZK 1:11" />That is what their faces looked like. Their wings were spread out, pointing upward. Each creature had two wings with which they touched each other. The other two wings covered their bodies. <verse eid="EZK 1:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="EZK 1:12" />Each of the creatures went straight ahead. They went wherever their spirit wanted to go, and they didn’t turn as they moved. <verse eid="EZK 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="EZK 1:13" />The living creatures looked like burning coals and torches. Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures. The fire was bright, and lightning came out of the fire. <verse eid="EZK 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="EZK 1:14" />The living creatures ran back and forth like lightning.<verse eid="EZK 1:14" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="EZK 1:15" />As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each of them. <verse eid="EZK 1:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="EZK 1:16" />This is how the wheels looked and how they were made: They looked like beryl. All four wheels looked the same. They looked like a wheel within a wheel. <verse eid="EZK 1:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="EZK 1:17" />Whenever they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without turning as they moved. <verse eid="EZK 1:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="EZK 1:18" />The rims of the wheels were large and frightening. They were covered with eyes.<verse eid="EZK 1:18" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" sid="EZK 1:19" />When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved with them. When the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose. <verse eid="EZK 1:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="EZK 1:20" />Wherever their spirit wanted to go, the creatures went. The wheels rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. <verse eid="EZK 1:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="EZK 1:21" />So whenever the creatures moved, the wheels moved. Whenever the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still. And whenever the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.<verse eid="EZK 1:21" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="22" style="v" sid="EZK 1:22" />Something like a dome was spread over the heads of the living creatures. It looked like dazzling crystal. <verse eid="EZK 1:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="EZK 1:23" />Under the dome, each creature had two wings that were stretched out straight, touching one another. Each creature had two wings that covered its body. <verse eid="EZK 1:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="EZK 1:24" />When the creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings. The sound was like the noise of rushing water, like the thunder of the Almighty, like the commotion in an army camp. When the creatures stood still, they lowered their wings.<verse eid="EZK 1:24" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="25" style="v" sid="EZK 1:25" />A voice came from above the dome over their heads as they stood still with their wings lowered. <verse eid="EZK 1:25" /><verse number="26" style="v" sid="EZK 1:26" />Above the dome over their heads was something that looked like a throne made of sapphire. On the throne was a figure that looked like a human. <verse eid="EZK 1:26" /><verse number="27" style="v" sid="EZK 1:27" />Then I saw what he looked like from the waist up. He looked like glowing bronze with fire all around it. From the waist down, he looked like fire. A bright light surrounded him. <verse eid="EZK 1:27" /><verse number="28" style="v" sid="EZK 1:28" />The brightness all around him looked like a rainbow in the clouds. It was like the <char style="nd">Lord</char>’s glory. When I saw it, I immediately bowed down, and I heard someone speaking.<verse eid="EZK 1:28" /></para>
