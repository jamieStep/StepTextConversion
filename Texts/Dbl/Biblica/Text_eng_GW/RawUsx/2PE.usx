  <para style="s1">God’s Power Gives Us the Ability to Live Godly Lives</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="2PE 1:3" />God’s divine power has given us everything we need for life and for godliness. This power was given to us through knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and integrity. <verse eid="2PE 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2PE 1:4" />Through his glory and integrity he has given us his promises that are of the highest value. Through these promises you will share in the divine nature because you have escaped the corruption that sinful desires cause in the world.<verse eid="2PE 1:4" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="2PE 1:5" />Because of this, make every effort to add integrity to your faith; and to integrity add knowledge; <verse eid="2PE 1:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2PE 1:6" />to knowledge add self-control; to self-control add endurance; to endurance add godliness; <verse eid="2PE 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2PE 1:7" />to godliness add Christian affection; and to Christian affection add love. <verse eid="2PE 1:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2PE 1:8" />If you have these qualities and they are increasing, it demonstrates that your knowledge about our Lord Jesus Christ is living and productive. <verse eid="2PE 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2PE 1:9" />If these qualities aren’t present in your life, you’re shortsighted and have forgotten that you were cleansed from your past sins. <verse eid="2PE 1:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2PE 1:10" />Therefore, brothers and sisters, use more effort to make God’s calling and choosing of you secure.</para>
  <para style="p" vid="2PE 1:10">If you keep doing this, you will never fall away. <verse eid="2PE 1:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2PE 1:11" />Then you will also be given the wealth of entering into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.<verse eid="2PE 1:11" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="2PE 1:12" />Therefore, I will always remind you about these qualities, although you already know about them and are well-grounded in the truth that you now have. <verse eid="2PE 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2PE 1:13" />As long as I’m still alive, I think it’s right to refresh your memory. <verse eid="2PE 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="2PE 1:14" />I know that I will die soon. Our Lord Jesus Christ has made that clear to me. <verse eid="2PE 1:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="2PE 1:15" />So I will make every effort to see that you remember these things after I die.<verse eid="2PE 1:15" /></para>
  <para style="s1">Pay Attention to God’s Words</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="16" style="v" sid="2PE 1:16" />When we apostles told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, we didn’t base our message on clever myths that we made up. Rather, we witnessed his majesty with our own eyes. <verse eid="2PE 1:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="2PE 1:17" />For example, we were eyewitnesses when he received honor and glory from God the Father and when the voice of our majestic God spoke these words to him: “This is my Son, whom I love and in whom I delight.” <verse eid="2PE 1:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="2PE 1:18" />We heard that voice speak to him from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain. <verse eid="2PE 1:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="2PE 1:19" />So we regard the words of the prophets as confirmed beyond all doubt. You’re doing well by paying attention to their words. Continue to pay attention as you would to a light that shines in a dark place as you wait for day to come and the morning star to rise in your hearts. <verse eid="2PE 1:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="2PE 1:20" />First, you must understand this: No prophecy in Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation. <verse eid="2PE 1:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="2PE 1:21" />No prophecy ever originated from humans. Instead, it was given by the Holy Spirit as humans spoke under God’s direction.<verse eid="2PE 1:21" /></para>

  <para style="s1">Warnings about False Teachers</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="2PE 2:1" />False prophets were among God’s people <char style="add">⌞in the past⌟</char>, as false teachers will be among you. They will secretly bring in their own destructive teachings. They will deny the Lord, who has bought them, and they will bring themselves swift destruction. <verse eid="2PE 2:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2PE 2:2" />Many people will follow them in their sexual freedom and will cause others to dishonor the way of truth. <verse eid="2PE 2:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="2PE 2:3" />In their greed they will use good-sounding arguments to exploit you. The verdict against them from long ago is still in force, and their destruction is not asleep.<verse eid="2PE 2:3" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" sid="2PE 2:4" />God didn’t spare angels who sinned. He threw them into hell, where he has secured them with chains of darkness and is holding them for judgment.<verse eid="2PE 2:4" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="2PE 2:5" />God didn’t spare the ancient world either. He brought the flood on the world of ungodly people, but he protected Noah and seven other people. Noah was his messenger who told people about the kind of life that has God’s approval.<verse eid="2PE 2:5" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="2PE 2:6" />God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and destroyed them by burning them to ashes. He made those cities an example to ungodly people of what is going to happen to them. <verse eid="2PE 2:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2PE 2:7" />Yet, God rescued Lot, a man who had his approval. Lot was distressed by the lifestyle of people who had no principles and lived in sexual freedom. <verse eid="2PE 2:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2PE 2:8" />Although he was a man who had God’s approval, he lived among the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Each day was like torture to him as he saw and heard the immoral things that people did.<verse eid="2PE 2:8" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" sid="2PE 2:9" />Since the Lord did all this, he knows how to rescue godly people when they are tested. He also knows how to hold immoral people for punishment on the day of judgment. <verse eid="2PE 2:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2PE 2:10" />This is especially true of those who follow their corrupt nature along the path of impure desires and who despise the Lord’s authority.</para>
  <para style="p" vid="2PE 2:10">These false teachers are bold and arrogant. They aren’t afraid to insult the <char style="add">⌞Lord’s⌟</char> glory. <verse eid="2PE 2:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2PE 2:11" />Angels, who have more strength and power than these teachers, don’t bring an insulting judgment against them from the Lord. <verse eid="2PE 2:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2PE 2:12" />These false teachers insult what they don’t understand. They are like animals, which are creatures of instinct that are born to be caught and killed. So they will be destroyed like animals <verse eid="2PE 2:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2PE 2:13" />and lose what their wrongdoing earned them.</para>
  <para style="p" vid="2PE 2:13">These false teachers are stains and blemishes. They take pleasure in holding wild parties in broad daylight. They especially enjoy deceiving you while they eat with you. <verse eid="2PE 2:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="2PE 2:14" />They’re always looking for an adulterous woman. They can’t stop looking for sin as they seduce people who aren’t sure of what they believe. Their minds are focused on their greed. They are cursed.<verse eid="2PE 2:14" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="2PE 2:15" />These false teachers have left the straight path and wandered off to follow the path of Balaam, son of Beor. Balaam loved what his wrongdoing earned him. <verse eid="2PE 2:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2PE 2:16" />But he was convicted for his evil. A donkey, which normally can’t talk, spoke with a human voice and wouldn’t allow the prophet to continue his insanity.<verse eid="2PE 2:16" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="2PE 2:17" />These false teachers are dried-up springs. They are a mist blown around by a storm. Gloomy darkness has been kept for them. <verse eid="2PE 2:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="2PE 2:18" />They arrogantly use nonsense to seduce people by appealing to their sexual desires, especially to sexual freedom. They seduce people who have just escaped from those who live in error. <verse eid="2PE 2:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="2PE 2:19" />They promise these people freedom, but they themselves are slaves to corruption. A person is a slave to whatever he gives in to.<verse eid="2PE 2:19" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" sid="2PE 2:20" />People can know our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and escape the world’s filth. But if they get involved in this filth again and give in to it, they are worse off than they were before. <verse eid="2PE 2:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="2PE 2:21" />It would have been better for them never to have known the way of life that God approves of than to know it and turn their backs on the holy life God told them to live. <verse eid="2PE 2:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="2PE 2:22" />These proverbs have come true for them: “A dog goes back to its vomit,” and “A sow that has been washed goes back to roll around in the mud.”<verse eid="2PE 2:22" /></para>

  <para style="s1">Be Ready for the Day of the Lord</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="2PE 3:1" />Dear friends, this is the second letter I’m writing to you. In both letters I’m trying to refresh your memory. <verse eid="2PE 3:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2PE 3:2" />I want you to remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and what the Lord and Savior commanded you through your apostles.<verse eid="2PE 3:2" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="2PE 3:3" />First, you must understand this: In the last days people who follow their own desires will appear. These disrespectful people will ridicule <char style="add">⌞God’s promise⌟</char> <verse eid="2PE 3:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2PE 3:4" />by saying, “What’s happened to his promise to return? Ever since our ancestors died, everything continues as it did from the beginning of the world.”<verse eid="2PE 3:4" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="2PE 3:5" />They are deliberately ignoring one fact: Because of God’s word, heaven and earth existed a long time ago. The earth <char style="add">⌞appeared⌟</char> out of water and was kept alive by water. <verse eid="2PE 3:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2PE 3:6" />Water also flooded and destroyed that world. <verse eid="2PE 3:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2PE 3:7" />By God’s word, the present heaven and earth are designated to be burned. They are being kept until the day ungodly people will be judged and destroyed.<verse eid="2PE 3:7" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" sid="2PE 3:8" />Dear friends, don’t ignore this fact: One day with the Lord is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like one day. <verse eid="2PE 3:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2PE 3:9" />The Lord isn’t slow to do what he promised, as some people think. Rather, he is patient for your sake. He doesn’t want to destroy anyone but wants all people to have an opportunity to turn to him and change the way they think and act.<verse eid="2PE 3:9" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="2PE 3:10" />The day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that day heaven will pass away with a roaring sound. Everything that makes up the universe will burn and be destroyed. The earth and everything that people have done on it will be exposed.<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:10 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Some manuscripts and translations read </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">“will be burned up.”</char></note><verse eid="2PE 3:10" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="2PE 3:11" />All these things will be destroyed in this way. So think of the kind of holy and godly lives you must live <verse eid="2PE 3:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2PE 3:12" />as you look forward to the day of God and eagerly wait for it to come. When that day comes, heaven will be on fire and will be destroyed. Everything that makes up the universe will burn and melt. <verse eid="2PE 3:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2PE 3:13" />But we look forward to what God has promised—a new heaven and a new earth—a place where everything that has God’s approval lives.<verse eid="2PE 3:13" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="2PE 3:14" />Therefore, dear friends, with this to look forward to, make every effort to have him find you at peace, without <char style="add">⌞spiritual⌟</char> stains or blemishes. <verse eid="2PE 3:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="2PE 3:15" />Think of our Lord’s patience as an opportunity <char style="add">⌞for us⌟</char> to be saved. This is what our dear brother Paul wrote to you about, using the wisdom God gave him. <verse eid="2PE 3:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2PE 3:16" />He talks about this subject in all his letters. Some things in his letters are hard to understand. Ignorant people and people who aren’t sure of what they believe distort what Paul says in his letters the same way they distort the rest of the Scriptures. These people will be destroyed.<verse eid="2PE 3:16" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="2PE 3:17" />Dear friends, you already know these things. So be on your guard not to be carried away by the deception of people who have no principles. Then you won’t fall from your firm position. <verse eid="2PE 3:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="2PE 3:18" />But grow in the good will <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:18 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">“grace.”</char></note> and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Glory belongs to him now and for that eternal day! Amen.<verse eid="2PE 3:18" /></para>
