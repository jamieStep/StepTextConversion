    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="RUT 1:1" />In the days when the judges were ruling, there was a famine in the land.

One son married a woman named Orpah, and the other son married a woman named Ruth. They lived there for about ten years. <verse eid="RUT 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="RUT 1:5" />Then both Mahlon and Chilion died as well.

Go, because I am too old to get married again. If I said that I still have hope. … And if I had a husband tonight. … And even if I gave birth to sons, <verse eid="RUT 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="RUT 1:13" />would you wait until they grew up and stay single just for them? No, my daughters. My bitterness is much worse than yours because the <char style="nd">Lord</char> has sent me so much trouble.”<verse eid="RUT 1:13" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="RUT 1:14" />They began to cry loudly again.
