    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="PHP 1:12" />I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what happened to me has helped to spread the Good News. <verse eid="PHP 1:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="PHP 1:13" />As a result, it has become clear to all the soldiers who guard the emperor and to everyone else that I am in prison because of Christ. <verse eid="PHP 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="PHP 1:14" />So through my being in prison, the Lord has given most of our brothers and sisters confidence to speak God’s word more boldly and fearlessly than ever.<verse eid="PHP 1:14" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="PHP 1:15" />Some people tell the message about Christ because of their jealousy and envy. Others tell the message about him because of their good will. <verse eid="PHP 1:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="PHP 1:16" />Those who tell the message about Christ out of love know that God has put me here to defend the Good News. <verse eid="PHP 1:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="PHP 1:17" />But the others are insincere. They tell the message about Christ out of selfish ambition in order to stir up trouble for me while I’m in prison. <verse eid="PHP 1:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="PHP 1:18" />But what does it matter? Nothing matters except that, in one way or another, people are told the message about Christ, whether with honest or dishonest motives, and I’m happy about that.</para>

I know that I will be set free through your prayers and through the help that comes from the Spirit of Jesus Christ. <verse eid="PHP 1:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="PHP 1:20" />I eagerly expect and hope that I will have nothing to be ashamed of. I will speak very boldly and honor Christ in my body, now as always, whether I live or die. <verse eid="PHP 1:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="PHP 1:21" />Christ means everything to me in this life, and when I die I’ll have even more. <verse eid="PHP 1:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="PHP 1:22" />If I continue to live in this life, my work will produce more results. I don’t know which I would prefer. <verse eid="PHP 1:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="PHP 1:23" />I find it hard to choose between the two. I would like to leave this life and be with Christ. That’s by far the better choice. <verse eid="PHP 1:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="PHP 1:24" />But for your sake it’s better that I remain in this life. <verse eid="PHP 1:24" /><verse number="25" style="v" sid="PHP 1:25" />Since I’m convinced of this, I know that I will continue to live and be with all of you. This will help you to grow and be joyful in your faith. <verse eid="PHP 1:25" /><verse number="26" style="v" sid="PHP 1:26" />So by coming to you again, I want to give you even more reason to have pride in Christ Jesus with me.<verse eid="PHP 1:26" /></para>

This is God’s way of showing them that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved. <verse eid="PHP 1:28" /><verse number="29" style="v" sid="PHP 1:29" />God has given you the privilege not only to believe in Christ but also to suffer for him. <verse eid="PHP 1:29" /><verse number="30" style="v" sid="PHP 1:30" />You are involved in the same struggle that you saw me having.

Instead, humbly think of others as being better than yourselves. <verse eid="PHP 2:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="PHP 2:4" />Don’t be concerned only about your own interests, but also be concerned about the interests of others. <verse eid="PHP 2:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="PHP 2:5" />Have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.<verse eid="PHP 2:5" /></para>

He takes a genuine interest in your welfare. <verse eid="PHP 2:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="PHP 2:21" />Everyone else looks after his own interests, not after those of Jesus Christ. <verse eid="PHP 2:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="PHP 2:22" />But you know what kind of person Timothy proved to be. Like a father and son we worked hard together to spread the Good News. <verse eid="PHP 2:22" /><verse number="23" style="v" sid="PHP 2:23" />I hope to send him as soon as I see how things are going to turn out for me. <verse eid="PHP 2:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="PHP 2:24" />But the Lord gives me confidence that I will come <char style="add">⌞to visit you⌟</char> soon.<verse eid="PHP 2:24" /></para>

But God had mercy not only on him but also on me and kept me from having one sorrow on top of another. <verse eid="PHP 2:27" /><verse number="28" style="v" sid="PHP 2:28" />So I’m especially eager to send him to you. In this way you will have the joy of seeing him again and I will feel relieved. <verse eid="PHP 2:28" /><verse number="29" style="v" sid="PHP 2:29" />Give him a joyful Christian welcome.

If anyone else thinks that he can trust in something physical, I can claim even more. <verse eid="PHP 3:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="PHP 3:5" />I was circumcised on the eighth day. I’m a descendant of Israel. I’m from the tribe of Benjamin. I’m a pure-blooded Hebrew. When it comes to following Jewish laws, I was a Pharisee. <verse eid="PHP 3:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="PHP 3:6" />When it comes to being enthusiastic, I was a persecutor of the church.

I consider everything else worthless because I’m much better off knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. It’s because of him that I think of everything as worthless. I threw it all away in order to gain Christ <verse eid="PHP 3:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="PHP 3:9" />and to have a relationship with him. This means that I didn’t receive God’s approval by obeying his laws. The opposite is true! I have God’s approval through faith in Christ. This is the approval that comes from God and is based on faith <verse eid="PHP 3:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="PHP 3:10" />that knows Christ. Faith knows the power that his coming back to life gives and what it means to share his suffering. In this way I’m becoming like him in his death, <verse eid="PHP 3:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="PHP 3:11" />with the confidence that I’ll come back to life from the dead.<verse eid="PHP 3:11" /></para>

But I run to win that which Jesus Christ has already won for me. <verse eid="PHP 3:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="PHP 3:13" />Brothers and sisters, I can’t consider myself a winner yet. This is what I do: I don’t look back, I lengthen my stride, and <verse eid="PHP 3:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="PHP 3:14" />I run straight toward the goal to win the prize that God’s heavenly call offers in Christ Jesus.<verse eid="PHP 3:14" /></para>

Their own emotions are their god, and they take pride in the shameful things they do. Their minds are set on worldly things. <verse eid="PHP 3:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="PHP 3:20" />We, however, are citizens of heaven. We look forward to the Lord Jesus Christ coming from heaven as our Savior. <verse eid="PHP 3:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="PHP 3:21" />Through his power to bring everything under his authority, he will change our humble bodies and make them like his glorified body.<verse eid="PHP 3:21" /></para>
