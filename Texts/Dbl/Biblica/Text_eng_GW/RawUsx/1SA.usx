    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="1SA 1:1" />There was a man named Elkanah from Ramathaim Zophim in the mountains of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, grandson of Elihu, great-grandson of Tohu, whose father was Zuph from the tribe of Ephraim. <verse eid="1SA 1:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="1SA 1:2" />Elkanah had two wives, one named Hannah, the other Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none. <verse eid="1SA 1:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="1SA 1:3" />Every year this man would go from his own city to worship and sacrifice to the <char style="nd">Lord</char> of Armies at Shiloh.
