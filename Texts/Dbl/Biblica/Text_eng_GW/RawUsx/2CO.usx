    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="2CO 1:3" />Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He is the Father who is compassionate and the God who gives comfort. <verse eid="2CO 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2CO 1:4" />He comforts us whenever we suffer. That is why whenever other people suffer, we are able to comfort them by using the same comfort we have received from God. <verse eid="2CO 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="2CO 1:5" />Because Christ suffered so much for us, we can receive so much comfort from him. <verse eid="2CO 1:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 1:6" />Besides, if we suffer, it brings you comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, we can effectively comfort you when you endure the same sufferings that we endure. <verse eid="2CO 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2CO 1:7" />We have confidence in you. We know that as you share our sufferings, you also share our comfort.<verse eid="2CO 1:7" /></para>

  <para style="m">
    <verse number="8" style="v" sid="2CO 1:8" />Brothers and sisters, we don’t want you to be ignorant about the suffering we experienced in the province of Asia. It was so extreme that it was beyond our ability to endure. We even wondered if we could go on living. <verse eid="2CO 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 1:9" />In fact, we still feel as if we’re under a death sentence. But we suffered so that we would stop trusting ourselves and learn to trust God, who brings the dead back to life. <verse eid="2CO 1:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 1:10" />He has rescued us from a terrible death, and he will rescue us in the future. We are confident that he will continue to rescue us, <verse eid="2CO 1:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 1:11" />since you are also joining to help us when you pray for us. Then many people will thank God for the favor he will show us because many people prayed for us.<verse eid="2CO 1:11" /></para>

  <para style="m">
    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 1:12" />We are proud that our conscience is clear. We are proud of the way that we have lived in this world.

I hope you will understand this as long as you live, <verse eid="2CO 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="2CO 1:14" />even though you now understand it only partially. We are your reason to be proud, as you will be our reason to be proud on the day of our Lord Jesus.<verse eid="2CO 1:14" /></para>
  <para style="s1">Why Paul Changed His Plans</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="2CO 1:15" />Confident of this, I had previously wanted to visit you so that you could benefit twice. <verse eid="2CO 1:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2CO 1:16" />My plans had been to go from the city of Corinth to the province of Macedonia. Then from Macedonia I had planned to return to you again in Corinth and have you support my trip to Judea.<verse eid="2CO 1:16" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 1:17" />You don’t think that I made these plans lightly, do you? Do you think that when I make plans, I make them in a sinful way? Why would I say that something is true when it isn’t? <verse eid="2CO 1:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="2CO 1:18" />You can depend on God. Our message to you isn’t false; it’s true. <verse eid="2CO 1:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="2CO 1:19" />God’s Son, Jesus Christ, whom I, Silvanus, and Timothy told you about, was true not false. Because of him our message was always true. <verse eid="2CO 1:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="2CO 1:20" />Certainly, Christ made God’s many promises come true. For that reason, because of our message, people also honor God by saying, “Amen!”<verse eid="2CO 1:20" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" sid="2CO 1:21" />God establishes us, together with you, in a relationship with Christ. He has also anointed us. <verse eid="2CO 1:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="2CO 1:22" />In addition, he has put his seal <char style="add">⌞of ownership⌟</char> on us and has given us the Spirit as his guarantee.<verse eid="2CO 1:22" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" sid="2CO 1:23" />I appeal to God as a witness on my behalf, that I stayed away from Corinth because I wanted to spare you. <verse eid="2CO 1:23" /><verse number="24" style="v" sid="2CO 1:24" />It isn’t that we want to have control over your Christian faith. Rather, we want to work with you so that you will be happy. Certainly, you are firmly established in the Christian faith.<verse eid="2CO 1:24" /></para>
  <chapter eid="2CO 1" />
  <chapter number="2" style="c" sid="2CO 2" />
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="2CO 2:1" />I decided not to visit you again while I was distressed. <verse eid="2CO 2:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2CO 2:2" />After all, if I had made you uncomfortable, how could you have cheered me up when you were uncomfortable?<verse eid="2CO 2:2" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="2CO 2:3" />This is the very reason I wrote to you. I didn’t want to visit you and be distressed by those who should make me happy. I’m confident about all of you that whatever makes me happy also makes you happy.<verse eid="2CO 2:3" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" sid="2CO 2:4" />I was deeply troubled and anguished. In fact, I had tears in my eyes when I wrote to you. I didn’t write to make you uncomfortable but to let you know how much I love you.<verse eid="2CO 2:4" /></para>
  <para style="s1">Forgive the Person Who Sinned</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="2CO 2:5" />If someone caused distress, I’m not the one really affected. To some extent—although I don’t want to emphasize this too much—it has affected all of you. <verse eid="2CO 2:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 2:6" />The majority of you have imposed a severe enough punishment on that person. <verse eid="2CO 2:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2CO 2:7" />So now forgive and comfort him. Such distress could overwhelm someone like that if he’s not forgiven and comforted. <verse eid="2CO 2:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2CO 2:8" />That is why I urge you to assure him that you love him. <verse eid="2CO 2:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 2:9" />I had also written to you to test you. I wanted to see if you would be obedient in every way.<verse eid="2CO 2:9" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 2:10" />If you forgive someone, so do I. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, I did in the presence of Christ for your benefit. <verse eid="2CO 2:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 2:11" />I don’t want Satan to outwit us. After all, we are not ignorant about Satan’s scheming.<verse eid="2CO 2:11" /></para>
  <para style="s1">Paul’s Mission as Christ’s Spokesman</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 2:12" />When I went to the city of Troas, the Lord gave me an opportunity to spread the Good News about Christ. <verse eid="2CO 2:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2CO 2:13" />But I didn’t have any peace of mind, because I couldn’t find Titus, our brother, there. So I said goodbye to the people in Troas and went to the province of Macedonia.<verse eid="2CO 2:13" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="2CO 2:14" />But I thank God, who always leads us in victory because of Christ. Wherever we go, God uses us to make clear what it means to know Christ. It’s like a fragrance that fills the air. <verse eid="2CO 2:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="2CO 2:15" />To God we are the aroma of Christ among those who are saved and among those who are dying. <verse eid="2CO 2:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2CO 2:16" />To some people we are a deadly fragrance, while to others we are a life-giving fragrance.</para>
  <para style="p" vid="2CO 2:16">Who is qualified to tell about Christ? <verse eid="2CO 2:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 2:17" />At least we don’t go around selling an impure word of God like many others. The opposite is true. As Christ’s spokesmen and in God’s presence, we speak the pure message that comes from God.<verse eid="2CO 2:17" /></para>
  <chapter eid="2CO 2" />
  <chapter number="3" style="c" sid="2CO 3" />
  <para style="s1">The Ministry That Comes from Christ Is Greater Than Moses’ Ministry</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="2CO 3:1" />Do we have to show you our qualifications again? Do we, like some people, need letters that recommend us to you or letters from you that recommend us to others? <verse eid="2CO 3:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2CO 3:2" />You’re our letter of recommendation written in our hearts that everyone knows and reads. <verse eid="2CO 3:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="2CO 3:3" />It’s clear that you are Christ’s letter, written as a result of our ministry. You are a letter written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, a letter written not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.<verse eid="2CO 3:3" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="4" style="v" sid="2CO 3:4" />Christ gives us confidence about you in God’s presence. <verse eid="2CO 3:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="2CO 3:5" />By ourselves we are not qualified in any way to claim that we can do anything. Rather, God makes us qualified. <verse eid="2CO 3:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 3:6" />He has also qualified us to be ministers of a new promise,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">3:6 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">“covenant.”</char></note> a spiritual promise, not a written one. Clearly, what was written brings death, but the Spirit brings life.<verse eid="2CO 3:6" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" sid="2CO 3:7" />The ministry that brought death was inscribed on stone. Yet, it came with such glory that the people of Israel couldn’t look at Moses’ face. His face was shining with glory, even though that glory was fading. <verse eid="2CO 3:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2CO 3:8" />Won’t the ministry that brings the Spirit have even more glory? <verse eid="2CO 3:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 3:9" />If the ministry that brings punishment has glory, then the ministry that brings God’s approval has an overwhelming glory. <verse eid="2CO 3:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 3:10" />In fact, the ministry that brings punishment lost its glory because of the superior glory of the other ministry. <verse eid="2CO 3:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 3:11" />If that former ministry faded away despite its glory, how much more does that ministry which remains continue to be glorious?<verse eid="2CO 3:11" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 3:12" />Since we have confidence <char style="add">⌞in the new promise⌟</char>, we speak very boldly. <verse eid="2CO 3:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2CO 3:13" />We are not like Moses. He kept covering his face with a veil. He didn’t want the people of Israel to see the glory fading away. <verse eid="2CO 3:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="2CO 3:14" />However, their minds became closed. In fact, to this day the same veil is still there when they read the Old Testament. It isn’t removed, because only Christ can remove it. <verse eid="2CO 3:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="2CO 3:15" />Yet, even today, when they read the books of Moses, a veil covers their minds. <verse eid="2CO 3:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2CO 3:16" />But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.<verse eid="2CO 3:16" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 3:17" />This Lord is the Spirit. Wherever the Lord’s Spirit is, there is freedom. <verse eid="2CO 3:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="2CO 3:18" />As all of us reflect the Lord’s glory with faces that are not covered with veils, we are being changed into his image with ever-increasing glory. This comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.<verse eid="2CO 3:18" /></para>
  <chapter eid="2CO 3" />
  <chapter number="4" style="c" sid="2CO 4" />
  <para style="s1">Paul Is Never Discouraged</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="2CO 4:1" />We don’t become discouraged, since God has given us this ministry through his mercy. <verse eid="2CO 4:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2CO 4:2" />Instead, we have refused to use secret and shameful ways. We don’t use tricks, and we don’t distort God’s word. As God watches, we clearly reveal the truth to everyone. This is our <char style="add">⌞letter of⌟</char> recommendation.<verse eid="2CO 4:2" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="2CO 4:3" />So if the Good News that we tell others is covered with a veil, it is hidden from those who are dying. <verse eid="2CO 4:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2CO 4:4" />The god of this world has blinded the minds of those who don’t believe. As a result, they don’t see the light of the Good News about Christ’s glory. It is Christ who is God’s image.<verse eid="2CO 4:4" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="2CO 4:5" />Our message is not about ourselves. It is about Jesus Christ as the Lord. We are your servants for his sake. <verse eid="2CO 4:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 4:6" />We are his servants because the same God who said that light should shine out of darkness has given us light. For that reason we bring to light the knowledge about God’s glory which shines from Christ’s face.<verse eid="2CO 4:6" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" sid="2CO 4:7" />Our bodies are made of clay, yet we have the treasure of the Good News in them. This shows that the superior power of this treasure belongs to God and doesn’t come from us. <verse eid="2CO 4:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2CO 4:8" />In every way we’re troubled, but we aren’t crushed by our troubles. We’re frustrated, but we don’t give up. <verse eid="2CO 4:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 4:9" />We’re persecuted, but we’re not abandoned. We’re captured, but we’re not killed. <verse eid="2CO 4:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 4:10" />We always carry around the death of Jesus in our bodies so that the life of Jesus is also shown in our bodies. <verse eid="2CO 4:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 4:11" />While we are alive, we are constantly handed over to death for Jesus’ sake so that the life of Jesus is also shown in our mortal nature. <verse eid="2CO 4:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 4:12" />Death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.<verse eid="2CO 4:12" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="2CO 4:13" />The following is written, “I believed; therefore, I spoke.” We have that same spirit of faith. We also believe; therefore, we also speak. <verse eid="2CO 4:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="2CO 4:14" />We know that the one who brought the Lord Jesus back to life will also bring us back to life through Jesus. He will present us to God together with you.<verse eid="2CO 4:14" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="2CO 4:15" />All this is for your sake so that, as God’s kindness <note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">4:15 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Or </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">“grace.”</char></note> overflows in the lives of many people, it will produce even more thanksgiving to the glory of God. <verse eid="2CO 4:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2CO 4:16" />That is why we are not discouraged. Though outwardly we are wearing out, inwardly we are renewed day by day. <verse eid="2CO 4:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 4:17" />Our suffering is light and temporary and is producing for us an eternal glory that is greater than anything we can imagine. <verse eid="2CO 4:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="2CO 4:18" />We don’t look for things that can be seen but for things that can’t be seen. Things that can be seen are only temporary. But things that can’t be seen last forever.<verse eid="2CO 4:18" /></para>

  <para style="s1">Faith Guides Our Lives</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="2CO 5:1" />We know that if the life we live here on earth is ever taken down like a tent, we still have a building from God. It is an eternal house in heaven that isn’t made by human hands. <verse eid="2CO 5:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2CO 5:2" />In our present tent-like existence we sigh, since we long to put on the house we will have in heaven. <verse eid="2CO 5:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="2CO 5:3" />After we have put it on,<note caller="+" style="f"><char style="fr" closed="false">5:3 </char><char style="ft" closed="false">Some manuscripts and translations read </char><char style="fqa" closed="false">“taken it off.”</char></note> we won’t be naked. <verse eid="2CO 5:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2CO 5:4" />While we are in this tent, we sigh. We feel distressed because we don’t want to take off the tent, but we do want to put on the eternal house. Then <char style="add">⌞eternal⌟</char> life will put an end to our mortal existence. <verse eid="2CO 5:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="2CO 5:5" />God has prepared us for this and has given us his Spirit to guarantee it.<verse eid="2CO 5:5" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 5:6" />So we are always confident. We know that as long as we are living in these bodies, we are living away from the Lord. <verse eid="2CO 5:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2CO 5:7" />Indeed, our lives are guided by faith, not by sight. <verse eid="2CO 5:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2CO 5:8" />We are confident and prefer to live away from this body and to live with the Lord. <verse eid="2CO 5:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 5:9" />Whether we live in the body or move out of it, our goal is to be pleasing to him. <verse eid="2CO 5:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 5:10" />All of us must appear in front of Christ’s judgment seat. Then all people will receive what they deserve for the good or evil they have done while living in their bodies.<verse eid="2CO 5:10" /></para>
  <para style="s1">Christ’s Love Guides Us</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 5:11" />As people who know what it means to fear the Lord, we try to persuade others. God already knows what we are, and I hope that you also know what we are. <verse eid="2CO 5:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 5:12" />We are not trying to show you our qualifications again, but we are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us. Then you can answer those who are proud of their appearance rather than their character. <verse eid="2CO 5:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2CO 5:13" />So if we were crazy, it was for God. If we are sane, it is for you. <verse eid="2CO 5:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="2CO 5:14" />Clearly, Christ’s love guides us. We are convinced of the fact that one man has died for all people. Therefore, all people have died. <verse eid="2CO 5:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="2CO 5:15" />He died for all people so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for the man who died and was brought back to life for them.<verse eid="2CO 5:15" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" sid="2CO 5:16" />So from now on we don’t think of anyone from a human point of view. If we did think of Christ from a human point of view, we don’t anymore. <verse eid="2CO 5:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 5:17" />Whoever is a believer in Christ is a new creation. The old way of living has disappeared. A new way of living has come into existence. <verse eid="2CO 5:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="2CO 5:18" />God has done all this. He has restored our relationship with him through Christ, and has given us this ministry of restoring relationships. <verse eid="2CO 5:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="2CO 5:19" />In other words, God was using Christ to restore his relationship with humanity. He didn’t hold people’s faults against them, and he has given us this message of restored relationships to tell others. <verse eid="2CO 5:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="2CO 5:20" />Therefore, we are Christ’s representatives, and through us God is calling you. We beg you on behalf of Christ to become reunited with God. <verse eid="2CO 5:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="2CO 5:21" />God had Christ, who was sinless, take our sin so that we might receive God’s approval through him.<verse eid="2CO 5:21" /></para>
