    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="2TH 1:3" />We always have to thank God for you, brothers and sisters. It’s right to do this because your faith is showing remarkable growth and your love for each other is increasing. <verse eid="2TH 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2TH 1:4" />That’s why we brag in God’s churches about your endurance and faith in all the persecutions and suffering you are experiencing. <verse eid="2TH 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="2TH 1:5" />Your suffering proves that God’s judgment is right and that you are considered worthy of his kingdom.<verse eid="2TH 1:5" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="2TH 1:6" />Certainly, it is right for God to give suffering to those who cause you to suffer. <verse eid="2TH 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2TH 1:7" />It is also right for God to give all of us relief from our suffering. He will do this when the Lord Jesus is revealed, <char style="add">⌞coming⌟</char> from heaven with his mighty angels in a blazing fire. <verse eid="2TH 1:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2TH 1:8" />He will take revenge on those who refuse to acknowledge God and on those who refuse to respond to the Good News about our Lord Jesus. <verse eid="2TH 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2TH 1:9" />They will pay the penalty by being destroyed forever, by being separated from the Lord’s presence and from his glorious power. <verse eid="2TH 1:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2TH 1:10" /><char style="add">⌞This will happen⌟</char> on that day when he comes to be honored among all his holy people and admired by all who have believed in him. This includes you because you believed the testimony we gave you.<verse eid="2TH 1:10" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="2TH 1:11" />With this in mind, we always pray that our God will make you worthy of his call.

Then, because of the good will of Jesus Christ, our God and Lord, you will be honored by him.<verse eid="2TH 1:12" /></para>

  <para style="s1">Don’t Be Deceived about the Day of the Lord</para>
  <para style="m">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="2TH 2:1" />Brothers and sisters, we have this request to make of you about our Lord Jesus Christ’s coming and our gathering to meet him. <verse eid="2TH 2:1" /><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2TH 2:2" />Don’t get upset right away or alarmed when someone claims that we said through some spirit, conversation, or letter that the day of the Lord has already come. <verse eid="2TH 2:2" /><verse number="3" style="v" sid="2TH 2:3" />Don’t let anyone deceive you about this in any way. <char style="add">⌞That day cannot come unless⌟</char> a revolt takes place first, and the man of sin, the man of destruction, is revealed. <verse eid="2TH 2:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2TH 2:4" />He opposes every so-called god or anything that is worshiped and places himself above them, sitting in God’s temple and claiming to be God.<verse eid="2TH 2:4" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="2TH 2:5" />Don’t you remember that I told you about these things when I was still with you? <verse eid="2TH 2:5" /><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2TH 2:6" />You know what it is that now holds him back, so that he will be revealed when his time comes. <verse eid="2TH 2:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2TH 2:7" />The mystery of this sin is already at work. But it cannot work effectively until the person now holding it back gets out of the way. <verse eid="2TH 2:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2TH 2:8" />Then the man of sin will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will destroy him by what he says. When the Lord Jesus comes, his appearance will put an end to this man.<verse eid="2TH 2:8" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" sid="2TH 2:9" />The man of sin will come with the power of Satan. He will use every kind of power, including miraculous and wonderful signs. But they will be lies. <verse eid="2TH 2:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2TH 2:10" />He will use everything that God disapproves of to deceive those who are dying, those who refused to love the truth that would save them. <verse eid="2TH 2:10" /><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2TH 2:11" />That’s why God will send them a powerful delusion so that they will believe a lie. <verse eid="2TH 2:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2TH 2:12" />Then everyone who did not believe the truth, but was delighted with what God disapproves of, will be condemned.<verse eid="2TH 2:12" /></para>

We lived a disciplined life among you. <verse eid="2TH 3:7" /><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2TH 3:8" />We didn’t eat anyone’s food without paying for it. Instead, we worked hard and struggled night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you. <verse eid="2TH 3:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2TH 3:9" />It’s not as though we didn’t have a right to receive support. Rather, we wanted to set an example for you to follow. <verse eid="2TH 3:9" /><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2TH 3:10" />While we were with you, we gave you the order: “Whoever doesn’t want to work shouldn’t be allowed to eat.”<verse eid="2TH 3:10" /></para>

    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="2TH 3:11" />We hear that some of you are not living disciplined lives. You’re not working, so you go around interfering in other people’s lives. <verse eid="2TH 3:11" /><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2TH 3:12" />We order and encourage such people by the Lord Jesus Christ to pay attention to their own work so they can support themselves. <verse eid="2TH 3:12" /><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2TH 3:13" />Brothers and sisters, we can’t allow ourselves to get tired of doing what is right.<verse eid="2TH 3:13" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="2TH 3:14" />It may be that some people will not listen to what we say in this letter.
