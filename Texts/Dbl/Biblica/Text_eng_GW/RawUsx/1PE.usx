    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="1PE 1:3" />Praise the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! God has given us a new birth because of his great mercy. We have been born into a new life that has a confidence which is alive because Jesus Christ has come back to life. <verse eid="1PE 1:3" /><verse number="4" style="v" sid="1PE 1:4" />We have been born into a new life which has an inheritance that can’t be destroyed or corrupted and can’t fade away. That inheritance is kept in heaven for you, <verse eid="1PE 1:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="1PE 1:5" />since you are guarded by God’s power through faith for a salvation that is ready to be revealed at the end of time.<verse eid="1PE 1:5" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="1PE 1:6" />You are extremely happy about these things, even though you have to suffer different kinds of trouble for a little while now. <verse eid="1PE 1:6" /><verse number="7" style="v" sid="1PE 1:7" />The purpose of these troubles is to test your faith as fire tests how genuine gold is. Your faith is more precious than gold, and by passing the test, it gives praise, glory, and honor to God. This will happen when Jesus Christ appears again.<verse eid="1PE 1:7" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" sid="1PE 1:8" />Although you have never seen Christ, you love him. You don’t see him now, but you believe in him. You are extremely happy with joy and praise that can hardly be expressed in words <verse eid="1PE 1:8" /><verse number="9" style="v" sid="1PE 1:9" />as you obtain the salvation that is the goal of your faith.<verse eid="1PE 1:9" /></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="1PE 1:10" />The prophets carefully researched and investigated this salvation.

What the prophets had spoken, the Holy Spirit, who was sent from heaven, has now made known to you by those who spread the Good News among you. These are things that even the angels want to look into.<verse eid="1PE 1:12" /></para>

  <para style="m">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="1PE 1:13" />Therefore, your minds must be clear and ready for action. Place your confidence completely in what God’s kindness will bring you when Jesus Christ appears again. <verse eid="1PE 1:13" /><verse number="14" style="v" sid="1PE 1:14" />Because you are children who obey God, don’t live the kind of lives you once lived. Once you lived to satisfy your desires because you didn’t know any better. <verse eid="1PE 1:14" /><verse number="15" style="v" sid="1PE 1:15" />But because the God who called you is holy, you must be holy in every aspect of your life. <verse eid="1PE 1:15" /><verse number="16" style="v" sid="1PE 1:16" />Scripture says, “Be holy, because I am holy.” <verse eid="1PE 1:16" /><verse number="17" style="v" sid="1PE 1:17" />So if you call God your Father, live your time as temporary residents on earth in fear. He is the God who judges all people by what they have done, and he doesn’t play favorites. <verse eid="1PE 1:17" /><verse number="18" style="v" sid="1PE 1:18" />Realize that you weren’t set free from the worthless life handed down to you from your ancestors by a payment of silver or gold which can be destroyed. <verse eid="1PE 1:18" /><verse number="19" style="v" sid="1PE 1:19" />Rather, the payment that freed you was the precious blood of Christ, the lamb with no defects or imperfections. <verse eid="1PE 1:19" /><verse number="20" style="v" sid="1PE 1:20" />He is the lamb who was known long ago before the world existed, but for your good he became publicly known in the last period of time. <verse eid="1PE 1:20" /><verse number="21" style="v" sid="1PE 1:21" />Through him you believe in God who brought Christ back to life and gave him glory.

Beauty expresses itself in a gentle and quiet attitude which God considers precious. <verse eid="1PE 3:4" /><verse number="5" style="v" sid="1PE 3:5" />After all, this is how holy women who had confidence in God expressed their beauty in the past.

    <verse number="18" style="v" sid="1PE 3:18" />This is true because Christ suffered for our sins once.

Baptism doesn’t save by removing dirt from the body. Rather, baptism is a request to God for a clear conscience. It saves you through Jesus Christ, who came back from death to life. <verse eid="1PE 3:21" /><verse number="22" style="v" sid="1PE 3:22" />Now Christ has gone to heaven where he holds the honored position—the one next to God the Father on the throne.
