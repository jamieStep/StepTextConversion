  <para style="im">Neither the author nor the specific audience for the book of Hebrews is known. It may be that the people who received the book were from Italy. The author does send greetings to them from those who are from Italy. But it is clear the book was written for Jews who believe in Jesus the Messiah. They were, however, in danger of leaving the faith. The book is clearly written to encourage them. It presents the truths God has revealed in his new covenant. It states that they are far better than the temporary ones of the first covenant. It encourages these new Jewish believers to remain strong in their faith in Jesus.</para>
  <para style="ip">The book presents two types of teachings. And it goes back and forth between the two types. One type reviews Israel’s history or tells about worship in the temple. The other type presents the challenges based on these teachings. The book presents four pairs of these sets of teachings.</para>
  <para style="ip">First, the writer states that Jesus and the salvation he brings are the greatest. Jesus is higher and greater than the angels and the law given by Moses.</para>
  <para style="ip">Second, the writer states that Jesus is our apostle. An apostle is one sent by God on a specific mission. Jesus brings us into a greater peace and a better, renewed land. These are far better than the land Moses and Joshua brought Israel to.</para>
  <para style="ip">Third, the writer states that Jesus is a more effective high priest. He is better than the priests appointed by the law of Moses.</para>
  <para style="ip">Fourth, believers are reminded to remain faithful as people have for many, many years. Believers must move forward in faith. They can do that because Jesus is bringing a kingdom that can’t be shaken.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="HEB 1:1"/>In the past, God spoke to our people through the prophets. He spoke at many times. He spoke in different ways. <verse eid="HEB 1:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="HEB 1:2"/>But in these last days, he has spoken to us through his Son. He is the one whom God appointed to receive all things. God also made everything through him. <verse eid="HEB 1:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="HEB 1:3"/>The Son is the shining brightness of God’s glory. He is the exact likeness of God’s being. He uses his powerful word to hold all things together. He provided the way for people to be made pure from sin. Then he sat down at the right hand of the King, the Majesty in heaven. <verse eid="HEB 1:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="HEB 1:4"/>So he became higher than the angels. The name he received is more excellent than theirs.<verse eid="HEB 1:4"/></para>

  <para style="s1">A Warning to Pay Attention</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="HEB 2:1"/>So we must pay the most careful attention to what we have heard. Then we will not drift away from it. <verse eid="HEB 2:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="HEB 2:2"/>Even the message God spoke through angels had to be obeyed. Every time people broke the Law, they were punished. Every time they didn’t obey, they were punished. <verse eid="HEB 2:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="HEB 2:3"/>Then how will we escape if we don’t pay attention to God’s great salvation? The Lord first announced this salvation. Those who heard him gave us the message about it. <verse eid="HEB 2:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="HEB 2:4"/>God showed that this message is true by signs and wonders. He showed that it’s true by different kinds of miracles. God also showed that this message is true by the gifts of the Holy Spirit. God gave them out as it pleased him.<verse eid="HEB 2:4"/></para>
  <para style="s1">Jesus Was Made Fully Human</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="HEB 2:5"/>God has not put angels in charge of the world that is going to come. We are talking about that world. <verse eid="HEB 2:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="HEB 2:6"/>There is a place where someone has spoken about this. He said,</para>
  <para style="q1" vid="HEB 2:6">“What are human beings that you think about them?</para>
  <para style="q2" vid="HEB 2:6">What is a son of man that you take care of him?<verse eid="HEB 2:6"/></para>

  <para style="m" vid="HEB 2:8">So God has put everything under his Son. Everything is under his control. We do not now see everything under his control. <verse eid="HEB 2:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="HEB 2:9"/>But we do see Jesus already given a crown of glory and honor. He was made lower than the angels for a little while. He suffered death. By the grace of God, he tasted death for everyone. That is why he was given his crown.<verse eid="HEB 2:9"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="HEB 2:10"/>God has made everything. He is now bringing his many sons and daughters to share in his glory. It is only right that Jesus is the one to lead them into their salvation. That’s because God made him perfect by his sufferings. <verse eid="HEB 2:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="HEB 2:11"/>And Jesus, who makes people holy, and the people he makes holy belong to the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters. <verse eid="HEB 2:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="HEB 2:12"/>He says,</para>
  <para style="q1" vid="HEB 2:12">“I will announce your name to my brothers and sisters.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="HEB 2:14"/>Those children have bodies made out of flesh and blood. So Jesus became human like them in order to die for them. By doing this, he could break the power of the devil. The devil is the one who rules over the kingdom of death. <verse eid="HEB 2:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="HEB 2:15"/>Jesus could set people free who were afraid of death. All their lives they were held as slaves by that fear. <verse eid="HEB 2:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="HEB 2:16"/>It is certainly Abraham’s children that he helps. He doesn’t help angels. <verse eid="HEB 2:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="HEB 2:17"/>So he had to be made like people, fully human in every way. Then he could serve God as a kind and faithful high priest. And then he could pay for the sins of the people by dying for them. <verse eid="HEB 2:17"/><verse number="18" style="v" sid="HEB 2:18"/>He himself suffered when he was tempted. Now he is able to help others who are being tempted.<verse eid="HEB 2:18"/></para>
