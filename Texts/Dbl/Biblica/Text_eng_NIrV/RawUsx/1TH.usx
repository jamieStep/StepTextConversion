  <para style="im">Paul, Silas and Timothy went to the city of Thessalonica. There they preached the good news about Jesus the Messiah. Many people became believers. But that caused disorder in the city. Paul and Silas were accused of disobeying the Roman emperor’s laws. That’s because they preached that there was another king. And that king was Jesus. Paul and Silas narrowly escaped and had to run away from the city.</para>
  <para style="ip">Later Paul became concerned about the believers in Thessalonica. These believers were suffering because of their faith. Because of this, Paul was afraid they would lose their faith. So Paul sent Timothy to encourage them. It was safe for Timothy to go there because he was Greek. When Timothy returned to Achaia where Paul was staying, he had good news. The believers in Thessalonica had remained faithful. So Paul wrote this letter to tell them how happy he was.</para>
  <para style="ip">In this short letter, Paul begins by remembering his time in Thessalonica. He gives thanks for the believers’ faith even though they have struggles and challenges. Paul then teaches them how to live lives that are pleasing to God. They are to avoid sexual immorality. They are to love one another. And they are to work hard to earn their own living.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul then writes about a very important question. The believers in Thessalonica were asking what happens to believers who die before Jesus returns. Paul explains that believers who die are not lost. They will be raised from the dead when Jesus returns as the world’s king. Paul reminds the Thessalonians that Jesus will appear suddenly when no one expects it. So they must live lives that are pleasing to God. Then they will not be ashamed when he comes again. Throughout the letter Paul tells them to keep up their good work.</para>

We know that he has chosen you. <verse eid="1TH 1:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="1TH 1:5"/>Our good news didn’t come to you only in words. It came with power. It came with the Holy Spirit’s help. He gave us complete faith in what we were preaching. You know how we lived among you for your good. <verse eid="1TH 1:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="1TH 1:6"/>We and the Lord were your examples. You followed us. You welcomed our message even when you were suffering terribly. You welcomed it with the joy the Holy Spirit gives. <verse eid="1TH 1:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="1TH 1:7"/>So you became a model to all the believers in the lands of Macedonia and Achaia. <verse eid="1TH 1:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="1TH 1:8"/>The Lord’s message rang out from you. That was true not only in Macedonia and Achaia. Your faith in God has also become known everywhere. So we don’t have to say anything about it. <verse eid="1TH 1:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="1TH 1:9"/>The believers themselves report the kind of welcome you gave us.

And you turned to serve the living and true God. <verse eid="1TH 1:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="1TH 1:10"/>They tell about how you are waiting for his Son to come from heaven.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="1TH 2:1"/>Brothers and sisters, you know that our visit to you produced results. <verse eid="1TH 2:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="1TH 2:2"/>You know what happened earlier in the city of Philippi. We suffered, and people treated us very badly there. But God gave us the boldness to tell you his good news. We preached to you even when people strongly opposed us. <verse eid="1TH 2:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="1TH 2:3"/>The appeal we make is based on truth. It comes from a pure heart. We are not trying to trick you. <verse eid="1TH 2:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="1TH 2:4"/>In fact, it is just the opposite. God has approved us to preach. He has trusted us with the good news. We aren’t trying to please people. We want to please God. He tests our hearts. <verse eid="1TH 2:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="1TH 2:5"/>As you know, we never praised you if we didn’t mean it. We didn’t put on a mask to cover up any sinful desire. God is our witness that this is true. <verse eid="1TH 2:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="1TH 2:6"/>We were not expecting people to praise us. We were not looking for praise from you or anyone else. Yet as Christ’s apostles, we could have used our authority over you. <verse eid="1TH 2:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="1TH 2:7"/>Instead, we were like young children when we were with you.</para>
  <para style="p" vid="1TH 2:7">As a mother feeds and cares for her little children, <verse eid="1TH 2:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="1TH 2:8"/>we cared for you. We loved you so much. So we were happy to share with you God’s good news. We were also happy to share our lives with you. <verse eid="1TH 2:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="1TH 2:9"/>Brothers and sisters, I am sure you remember how hard we worked. We labored night and day while we preached to you God’s good news. We didn’t want to cause you any expense. <verse eid="1TH 2:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="1TH 2:10"/>You are witnesses of how we lived among you believers. God is also a witness that we were holy and godly and without blame. <verse eid="1TH 2:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="1TH 2:11"/>You know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children. <verse eid="1TH 2:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="1TH 2:12"/>We gave you hope and strength. We comforted you. We really wanted you to live in a way that is worthy of God. He chooses you to enter his glorious kingdom.<verse eid="1TH 2:12"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="1TH 2:13"/>We never stop thanking God for the way you received his word. You heard it from us. But you didn’t accept it as a human word. You accepted it for what it really is. It is God’s word. It is really at work in you who believe. <verse eid="1TH 2:13"/><verse number="14" style="v" sid="1TH 2:14"/>Brothers and sisters, you became like the members of God’s churches in Judea. They are believers in Christ Jesus, just as you are. Your own people made you suffer. You went through the same things the church members in Judea suffered from the Jews. <verse eid="1TH 2:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="1TH 2:15"/>The Jews who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets also forced us to leave. They do not please God. They are enemies of everyone. <verse eid="1TH 2:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="1TH 2:16"/>They try to keep us from speaking to the Gentiles. These Jews don’t want the Gentiles to be saved. In this way, these Jews always increase their sins to the limit. God’s anger has come on them at last.<verse eid="1TH 2:16"/></para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="1TH 2:17"/>Brothers and sisters, we were separated from you for a short time. Apart from you, we were like children without parents. We were no longer with you in person. But we kept you in our thoughts. We really wanted to see you. So we tried very hard to do so. <verse eid="1TH 2:17"/><verse number="18" style="v" sid="1TH 2:18"/>We wanted to come to you. Again and again I, Paul, wanted to come. But Satan blocked our way. <verse eid="1TH 2:18"/><verse number="19" style="v" sid="1TH 2:19"/>What is our hope? What is our joy? When our Lord Jesus returns, what is the crown we will delight in? Isn’t it you? <verse eid="1TH 2:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="1TH 2:20"/>Yes, you are our glory and our joy.<verse eid="1TH 2:20"/></para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="1TH 3:1"/>We couldn’t wait any longer. So we thought it was best to be left by ourselves in Athens. <verse eid="1TH 3:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="1TH 3:2"/>We sent our brother Timothy to give you strength and hope in your faith. He works together with us in God’s service to spread the good news about Christ. <verse eid="1TH 3:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="1TH 3:3"/>We sent him so that no one would be upset by times of testing. You know very well that we have to go through times of testing. <verse eid="1TH 3:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="1TH 3:4"/>In fact, when we were with you, here is what we kept telling you. We were telling you that our enemies would make us suffer. As you know very well, it has turned out that way. <verse eid="1TH 3:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="1TH 3:5"/>That’s the reason I sent someone to find out about your faith. I couldn’t wait any longer. I was afraid that Satan had tempted you in some way. Then our work among you would have been useless.<verse eid="1TH 3:5"/></para>

He has also said that you desire to see us, just as we desire to see you. <verse eid="1TH 3:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="1TH 3:7"/>Brothers and sisters, in all our trouble and suffering your faith encouraged us. <verse eid="1TH 3:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="1TH 3:8"/>Now we really live, because you are standing firm in the Lord. <verse eid="1TH 3:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="1TH 3:9"/>How can we thank God enough for you? We thank God because of all the joy we have in his presence. We have this joy because of you. <verse eid="1TH 3:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="1TH 3:10"/>Night and day we pray very hard that we will see you again. We want to give you what is missing in your faith.<verse eid="1TH 3:10"/></para>

    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="1TH 3:11"/>Now may a way be opened up for us to come to you.

May your love for one another increase. May it also increase for everyone else. May it be just like our love for you. <verse eid="1TH 3:12"/><verse number="13" style="v" sid="1TH 3:13"/>May the Lord give you strength in your hearts.

In the name of the Lord Jesus we ask and beg you to do it more and more. <verse eid="1TH 4:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="1TH 4:2"/>You know the directions we gave you.

You should not take advantage of your brother or sister. The Lord will punish everyone who commits these kinds of sins. We have already told you and warned you about this. <verse eid="1TH 4:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="1TH 4:7"/>That’s because God chose us to live pure lives. He wants us to be holy. <verse eid="1TH 4:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="1TH 4:8"/>Suppose someone refuses to accept our teaching. They are not turning their back on us. They are turning their back on God. This same God gives you his Holy Spirit.<verse eid="1TH 4:8"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" sid="1TH 4:9"/>We don’t need to write to you about your love for one another. God himself has taught you to love one another. <verse eid="1TH 4:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="1TH 4:10"/>In fact, you do love all God’s family all around Macedonia. Brothers and sisters, we are asking you to love one another more and more. <verse eid="1TH 4:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="1TH 4:11"/>And do everything you can to live a quiet life. You should mind your own business.

    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="1TH 4:13"/>Brothers and sisters, we want you to know what happens to those who die. We don’t want you to mourn, as other people do. They mourn because they don’t have any hope. <verse eid="1TH 4:13"/><verse number="14" style="v" sid="1TH 4:14"/>We believe that Jesus died and rose again. When he returns, many who believe in him will have died already. We believe that God will bring them back with Jesus. <verse eid="1TH 4:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="1TH 4:15"/>This agrees with what the Lord has said. When the Lord comes, many of us will still be alive. We tell you that we will certainly not go up before those who have died. <verse eid="1TH 4:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="1TH 4:16"/>The Lord himself will come down from heaven. We will hear a loud command. We will hear the voice of the leader of the angels. We will hear a blast from God’s trumpet. Many who believe in Christ will have died already. They will rise first. <verse eid="1TH 4:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="1TH 4:17"/>After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them. We will be taken up in the clouds. We will meet the Lord in the air.

Those who get drunk, get drunk at night. <verse eid="1TH 5:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="1TH 5:8"/>But we belong to the day. So let us control ourselves. Let us put on our chest the armor of faith and love. Let us put on the hope of salvation like a helmet. <verse eid="1TH 5:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="1TH 5:9"/>God didn’t choose us to receive his anger. He chose us to receive salvation because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done. <verse eid="1TH 5:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="1TH 5:10"/>Jesus died for us. Some will be alive when he comes. Others will be dead. Either way, we will live together with him. <verse eid="1TH 5:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="1TH 5:11"/>So encourage one another with the hope you have. Build each other up.
