    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="2SA 1:6"/>“I just happened to be there on Mount Gilboa,” the young man said. “Saul was there too. He was leaning on his spear. The enemy chariots and chariot drivers had almost caught up with him. <verse eid="2SA 1:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2SA 1:7"/>Then he turned around and saw me. He called out to me.

    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="2SA 24:13"/>So Gad went to David. He said to him, “Take your choice. Do you want three years when there won’t be enough food in your land? Or do you want three months when you will run away from your enemies while they chase you? Or do you want three days when there will be a plague in your land? Think it over. Then take your pick. Tell me how to answer the one who sent me.”<verse eid="2SA 24:13"/></para>

    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="2SA 24:17"/>David saw the angel who was striking down the people. David said to the <char style="nd">Lord</char>, “I’m the one who has sinned.
