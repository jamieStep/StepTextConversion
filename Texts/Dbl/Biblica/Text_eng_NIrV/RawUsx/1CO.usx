  <para style="im">The book of Acts tells us how Paul preached the good news about Jesus the Messiah in northern Greece. But Paul had to leave that area quickly because it wasn’t safe. So he went to Achaia which is an area in southern Greece. Paul went to the city of Corinth where he would be safe. Corinth was a center for trade and business. It was a very wealthy city. While he was there, Paul began preaching the good news about Jesus. Many people became believers. So Paul stayed for one and a half years to teach them.</para>
  <para style="ip">After he left, the people of Corinth wrote Paul a letter. We do not have that letter now. But we do know some of the questions that were in it. The people of Corinth had accepted a common Greek idea that physical things are bad. They thought that only things of the spirit or soul were good. They wanted to free the human spirit from the body. This idea affected the way the people of Corinth thought and behaved. It affected the way they thought about marriage. It affected how they thought about taking part in special meals offered to false gods. It even affected the way they thought about the resurrection of Jesus. Paul speaks about all of these things in his first letter to the Corinthians. Paul also answers questions about the true worship of God.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul tells the people of Corinth that this form of the world is passing away. He tells them to spend their time working for the Lord. Paul tells them that a new world is coming. They will rise from the dead. All this will make their work for the Lord worthwhile.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul’s advice to the people of Corinth is also helpful for us. Paul’s words can be used to guide us. They are useful as we daily seek to follow Jesus today.</para>

They all walked through the Red Sea. <verse eid="1CO 10:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="1CO 10:2"/>They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea. <verse eid="1CO 10:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="1CO 10:3"/>They all ate the same spiritual food. <verse eid="1CO 10:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="1CO 10:4"/>They all drank the same spiritual water. They drank from the spiritual rock that went with them. That rock was Christ. <verse eid="1CO 10:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="1CO 10:5"/>But God was not pleased with most of them. Their bodies were scattered in the desert.<verse eid="1CO 10:5"/></para>

    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="1CO 10:6"/>Now those things happened as examples for us. They are supposed to keep us from wanting evil things. The people of Israel wanted these evil things. <verse eid="1CO 10:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="1CO 10:7"/>So don’t worship statues of gods, as some of them did. It is written, “The people sat down to eat and drink.

    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="1CO 10:11"/>Those things happened to them as examples for us. They were written down to warn us. That’s because we are living at the time when God’s work is being completed. <verse eid="1CO 10:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="1CO 10:12"/>So be careful. When you think you are standing firm, you might fall. <verse eid="1CO 10:12"/><verse number="13" style="v" sid="1CO 10:13"/>You are tempted in the same way all other human beings are. God is faithful. He will not let you be tempted any more than you can take. But when you are tempted, God will give you a way out.

Do I mean that a statue of a god is anything? <verse eid="1CO 10:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="1CO 10:20"/>No! But what is sacrificed by those who worship statues of gods is really sacrificed to demons. It is not sacrificed to God. I don’t want you to be sharing with demons. <verse eid="1CO 10:20"/><verse number="21" style="v" sid="1CO 10:21"/>You can’t drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too.
