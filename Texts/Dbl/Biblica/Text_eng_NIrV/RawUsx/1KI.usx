    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="1KI 1:1"/>King David was now very old. He couldn’t keep warm even when blankets were spread over him. <verse eid="1KI 1:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="1KI 1:2"/>So his attendants spoke to him.

    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="1KI 1:5"/>Adonijah was the son of David and his wife Haggith. He came forward and announced, “I’m going to be the next king.” So he got chariots and horses ready. He also got 50 men to run in front of him. <verse eid="1KI 1:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="1KI 1:6"/>His father had never tried to stop him from doing what he wanted to. His father had never asked him, “Why are you acting the way you do?” Adonijah was also very handsome. Now that Absalom was dead, Adonijah was David’s oldest son.<verse eid="1KI 1:6"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" sid="1KI 1:7"/>Adonijah talked things over with Joab, the son of Zeruiah. He also talked with Abiathar the priest.

It will also save the life of your son Solomon. <verse eid="1KI 1:12"/><verse number="13" style="v" sid="1KI 1:13"/>Go in and see King David. Say to him, ‘You are my king and master. You promised me, “You can be sure that your son Solomon will be king after me.
