  <para style="im">Ezekiel was a priest in Judah. He was taken as a prisoner by King Nebuchadnezzar. Ezekiel along with many other Israelites was taken to Babylon. That happened 597 years before Jesus the Messiah was born. After living five years in Babylon, God called Ezekiel to speak the word of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> to his people.</para>
  <para style="ip">Ezekiel brought these words as speeches in the form of poems. He presented these words to the people in public places. Ezekiel brought some of the <char style="nd">Lord</char>’s word in stories. He also described the dreams God sent to him.</para>
  <para style="ip">The book of Ezekiel has three main parts. The first part is about Israel’s disobedience and their punishment. The second part tells of God’s judgment against other nations. The third part describes how God will restore Israel.</para>
  <para style="ip">In the first part, Ezekiel tells of a vision he had. It tells that God has removed his presence from the temple in Jerusalem. And God did that because the people of Israel no longer obeyed his laws and commands. The second part has speeches against the nations. Their message is clear. Even though God’s temple is destroyed, he is still in control of the world.</para>
  <para style="ip">The book closes with promises. Ezekiel’s visions show the unfolding of God’s saving purposes in the world. God will renew the hearts of his people. And God will finally renew all life on earth. A sinful, broken world will be healed. That will happen when the <char style="nd">Lord</char> returns to live with his people. And it will be in a land that has become like the garden of Eden.</para>

    <verse number="4" style="v" sid="EZK 1:4"/>I looked up and saw a windstorm coming from the north. I saw a huge cloud. The fire of lightning was flashing out of it. Bright light surrounded it. The center of the fire looked like glowing metal. <verse eid="EZK 1:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="EZK 1:5"/>I saw in the fire something that looked like four living creatures. They appeared to have the shape of a human being. <verse eid="EZK 1:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="EZK 1:6"/>But each of them had four faces and four wings. <verse eid="EZK 1:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="EZK 1:7"/>Their legs were straight. Their feet looked like the feet of a calf. They were as bright as polished bronze. <verse eid="EZK 1:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="EZK 1:8"/>The creatures had human hands under their wings on their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings. <verse eid="EZK 1:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="EZK 1:9"/>The wings of one touched the wings of another. Each of the creatures went straight ahead.

    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="EZK 1:10"/>Here’s what their faces looked like. Each of the four creatures had the face of a human being. On the right side each had the face of a lion. On the left each had the face of an ox. Each one also had an eagle’s face. <verse eid="EZK 1:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="EZK 1:11"/>That’s what their faces looked like. They each had two wings that spread out and lifted up. Each wing touched the wing of another creature on either side. They each had two other wings that covered their bodies. <verse eid="EZK 1:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="EZK 1:12"/>All the creatures went straight ahead. Anywhere their spirits would lead them to go, they would go.

    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="EZK 1:15"/>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw wheels on the ground beside them. Each creature had four faces. <verse eid="EZK 1:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="EZK 1:16"/>Here’s how the wheels looked and worked. They gleamed like topaz. All four of them looked alike. Each one seemed to be made like a wheel inside another wheel at right angles. <verse eid="EZK 1:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="EZK 1:17"/>The wheels could go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced. The wheels didn’t change their direction as the creatures moved. <verse eid="EZK 1:17"/><verse number="18" style="v" sid="EZK 1:18"/>Their rims were high and terrifying.

When the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels also rose. <verse eid="EZK 1:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="EZK 1:20"/>Anywhere their spirits would lead them to go, they would go. And the wheels would rise along with them. That’s because the spirits of the living creatures were in the wheels. <verse eid="EZK 1:20"/><verse number="21" style="v" sid="EZK 1:21"/>When the living creatures moved, the wheels also moved. When the creatures stood still, they also stood still. When the creatures rose from the ground, the wheels rose along with them.

Each creature had two wings covering its body. <verse eid="EZK 1:23"/><verse number="24" style="v" sid="EZK 1:24"/>When the living creatures moved, I heard the sound of their wings. It was like the roar of rushing waters. It sounded like the thundering voice of the Mighty God. It was like the loud noise an army makes. When the creatures stood still, they lowered their wings.<verse eid="EZK 1:24"/></para>

    <verse number="25" style="v" sid="EZK 1:25"/>Then a voice came from above the huge space over their heads. They stood with their wings lowered. <verse eid="EZK 1:25"/><verse number="26" style="v" sid="EZK 1:26"/>Above the space over their heads was something that looked like a throne made out of lapis lazuli. On the throne high above was a figure that appeared to be a man. <verse eid="EZK 1:26"/><verse number="27" style="v" sid="EZK 1:27"/>From his waist up he looked like glowing metal that was full of fire.
