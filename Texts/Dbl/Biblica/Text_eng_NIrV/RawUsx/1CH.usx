  <para style="im">The books of 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah read like one long story. These books continue the story of Israel. They show that God’s people Israel are part of his plan for the world. Israel must be different from the people around them. The worship of God must be at the center of their lives. And that worship will take place in the rebuilt temple in Jerusalem. For Israel that would not be easy. They had been prisoners and slaves in a land far away. When they returned, they found their city and homes destroyed. Their temple for worshiping God was destroyed. Strangers had moved into their homes. And they did not have a ruler to lead them.</para>
  <para style="ip">The book of 1 Chronicles provides these returning Israelites with their history. It presents the family line of Israel beginning with Adam. It shows the place of the Israelites among the other nations. And it reminds the Israelites of their calling to be God’s people. The second book of Chronicles tells the story of the Israelites as a nation. This book describes the kings who lived in Jerusalem. They ruled Israel until they were taken away as prisoners.</para>
  <para style="ip">The books of Ezra and Nehemiah tell the story of what happened to the people when they came back to their land. Here the people once again promised to follow God’s ways for living.</para>
  <para style="ip">Taken together these books tell a temple history. The temple was a sign that God was among his people. True worship had been explained to Israel by God. The Israelites worshiped him first in the Tabernacle and later in the Temple. But all through history God’s people have struggled to keep his commands. They have struggled with holy living and true worship. But God continued working in and through his people to bring true worship to him. This was the task God had chosen Israel to do. They were to show to all nations what true worship was. And they were to show all the nations how to live as God’s people.</para>
