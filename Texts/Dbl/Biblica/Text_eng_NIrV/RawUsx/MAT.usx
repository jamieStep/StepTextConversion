  <para style="im">The book of Matthew begins by showing that God has kept his promises to Israel. Jesus is the promised Messiah, or king. The rule of God has come to earth. This is what the story of Israel is about. Matthew lists the names of the people in the family line of Jesus. Jesus came from the family line of Abraham, the ancestor of all the tribes of Israel. That family line continued to the great King David. Then Matthew shows that Jesus came from David’s family. God really had kept his ancient promises.</para>
  <para style="ip">Matthew makes connections between Jesus’ life and the story of Israel. Just as Israel crossed the Jordan River, Jesus went to the Jordan River. As Israel wandered in the desert, Jesus was tempted in the desert. In addition, Matthew presents Jesus as the new Moses. Matthew presents the story of Jesus’ life and work in five parts. These five sections contain the five main speeches given by Jesus. Each speech ends with words similar to “After Jesus finished saying all these things.” These five parts remind us of the five books of Moses in the Old Testament.</para>
  <para style="ip">Jesus celebrates a Passover meal with his disciples. This is just like the time Israel celebrated the Passover meal before leaving Egypt. After the Passover Israel was freed and no longer in slavery in Egypt. Jesus died on the cross and rose again to make his people free. Those who believe in him will be free from sin and death.</para>
  <para style="ip">At the beginning of the book, Jesus is given the name “Immanuel.” That name means “God with us.” At the end of the book, Jesus sends his followers into the world. He sends them out with a promise that he would always be with them.</para>

    <verse number="18" style="v" sid="MAT 1:18"/>This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah came about. His mother Mary and Joseph had promised to get married.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="MAT 2:1"/>Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea. This happened while Herod was king of Judea. After Jesus’ birth, Wise Men from the east came to Jerusalem. <verse eid="MAT 2:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="MAT 2:2"/>They asked, “Where is the child who has been born to be king of the Jews?

He also called the teachers of the law. He asked them where the Messiah was going to be born. <verse eid="MAT 2:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="MAT 2:5"/>“In Bethlehem in Judea,” they replied. “This is what the prophet has written.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="9" style="v" sid="MAT 2:9"/>After the Wise Men had listened to the king, they went on their way. The star they had seen when it rose went ahead of them. It finally stopped over the place where the child was. <verse eid="MAT 2:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="MAT 2:10"/>When they saw the star, they were filled with joy. <verse eid="MAT 2:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="MAT 2:11"/>The Wise Men went to the house. There they saw the child with his mother Mary. They bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures. They gave him gold, frankincense and myrrh. <verse eid="MAT 2:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="MAT 2:12"/>But God warned them in a dream not to go back to Herod.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="MAT 2:13"/>When the Wise Men had left, Joseph had a dream.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="MAT 2:14"/>So Joseph got up. During the night, he left for Egypt with the child and his mother Mary. <verse eid="MAT 2:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="MAT 2:15"/>They stayed there until King Herod died.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" sid="MAT 2:16"/>Herod realized that the Wise Men had tricked him. So he became very angry. He gave orders about Bethlehem and the area around it. He ordered all the boys two years old and under to be killed. This agreed with the time when the Wise Men had seen the star. <verse eid="MAT 2:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="MAT 2:17"/>In this way, the words Jeremiah the prophet spoke came true.

Archelaus was ruling in place of his father Herod. This made Joseph afraid to go there. Joseph had been warned in a dream. So he went back to the land of Galilee instead. <verse eid="MAT 2:22"/><verse number="23" style="v" sid="MAT 2:23"/>There he lived in a town called Nazareth.
