  <para style="im">Paul was in prison in Rome. He was waiting for his trial before the Emperor Caesar. It was during this time Paul wrote to the believers in the city of Colossae. Paul had never met this group of believers. But they knew who he was. And they respected Paul’s leadership and teaching. When Paul was in Ephesus, he had worked with a man named Epaphras. Epaphras was from the city of Colossae. So Paul sent Epaphras back to Colossae to bring the good new about Jesus. Epaphras shared the good news about Jesus in Colossae. He also brought the good news to the cities of Laodicea and Hierapolis. Epaphras was later arrested and brought to Rome as a prisoner. Paul learned what was happening in these cities from Epaphras.</para>
  <para style="ip">The people in Colossae were mostly Gentiles. But like the believers in Galatia they were being pushed to follow the Jewish laws. They were being asked to add extra rules and false teachings to their faith. Some of this group of believers thought they were better than the others. That’s because they had visions and believed they received secret spiritual knowledge. So Paul wrote this letter to all of them. Paul told them that nothing needs to be added to their faith. Faith in Jesus the Messiah is all they need to be saved.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul states clearly that all things in heaven and earth were created through Jesus. All things were brought back to God by Jesus’ death on the cross. Jesus Christ is the fullness of God’s being. Paul tells the Colossians that belief in Jesus Christ is all they need to be saved. God has made them into new people. So now they can live their faith to the fullest. Nothing needs to be added to it. Paul ends his letter with practical advice on how to live the new life of following Jesus.</para>

All things have been created by him and for him. <verse eid="COL 1:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="COL 1:17"/>Before anything was created, he was already there. He holds everything together. <verse eid="COL 1:17"/><verse number="18" style="v" sid="COL 1:18"/>And he is the head of the body, which is the church. He is the beginning. He is the first to be raised from the dead. That happened so that he would be far above everything. <verse eid="COL 1:18"/><verse number="19" style="v" sid="COL 1:19"/>God was pleased to have his whole nature living in Christ. <verse eid="COL 1:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="COL 1:20"/>God was pleased to bring all things back to himself.

He is the ruler over every power and authority. <verse eid="COL 2:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="COL 2:11"/>When you received Christ, your circumcision was not done by human hands. Instead, your circumcision was done by Christ. He put away the person you used to be. At that time, sin’s power ruled over you. <verse eid="COL 2:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="COL 2:12"/>When you were baptized, you were buried together with Christ.

    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="COL 2:13"/>At one time you were dead in your sins. Your desires controlled by sin were not circumcised. But God gave you new life together with Christ.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="16" style="v" sid="COL 2:16"/>So don’t let anyone judge you because of what you eat or drink. Don’t let anyone judge you about holy days. I’m talking about special feasts and New Moons and Sabbath days. <verse eid="COL 2:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="COL 2:17"/>They are only a shadow of the things to come. But what is real is found in Christ. <verse eid="COL 2:17"/><verse number="18" style="v" sid="COL 2:18"/>Some people enjoy pretending they aren’t proud. They worship angels. But don’t let people like that judge you. These people tell you every little thing about what they have seen. They are proud of their useless ideas. That’s because their minds are not guided by the Holy Spirit. <verse eid="COL 2:18"/><verse number="19" style="v" sid="COL 2:19"/>They aren’t connected anymore to the head, who is Christ. But the whole body grows from the head. The muscles and tendons hold the body together. And God causes it to grow.<verse eid="COL 2:19"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="20" style="v" sid="COL 2:20"/>Some people still follow the basic spiritual powers of the world. But you died with Christ as far as these powers are concerned.

Do not touch!” <verse eid="COL 2:21"/><verse number="22" style="v" sid="COL 2:22"/>Rules like these are about things that will pass away soon. They are based on merely human rules and teachings. <verse eid="COL 2:22"/><verse number="23" style="v" sid="COL 2:23"/>It is true that these rules seem wise. Because of them, people give themselves over to their own kind of worship. They pretend they are humble. They treat their bodies very badly. But rules like these don’t help. They don’t stop people from chasing after sinful pleasures.<verse eid="COL 2:23"/></para>
