  <para style="imt">Introduction</para>
  <para style="im">The book of Daniel tells the story of a young man when he was taken prisoner. He was taken to Babylon with other people from Israel. Daniel combines two types of writing. The first part of the book describes what happened to Daniel in the royal courts of Babylon and of Persia. Daniel and three of his friends worshiped God and obeyed his commands. But some people were jealous of Daniel and his friends. These people tried to get them in trouble. But God protected Daniel and his friends and kept them safe by his mighty acts.</para>
  <para style="ip">The second part of the book uses a different kind of writing called apocalyptic. Apocalyptic writing uses language that has a hidden meaning. In this kind of writing numbers and images are signs for something else. This second part of the book describes visions and messages Daniel received from God. Angels were sent as messengers to bring these messages and visions.</para>
  <para style="ip">These visions show the history of this part of the world. Powerful nations fight each other and try to rule the other nations. This includes the nations of Babylon and Persia. It includes powerful leaders like Alexander the Great from Greece. From these visions we see what happens to these nations.</para>
  <para style="ip">These visions also tell about a terrible ruler who fights against God’s people. He forces them to disobey God’s laws. That causes some Jews called Maccabees to oppose him. This fighting makes Israel an independent nation once again. And it would save the true worship of the God of Israel.</para>
  <para style="ip">Daniel’s visions show that there will be a clear conflict between God’s people and their enemies. This is true in Daniel’s time and also later. But God will support his people through their struggles. God will destroy all rulers and evil powers. God’s people can be encouraged. They can know that God’s kingdom is theirs forever. They can look forward to the time when God will come. He will live with his people in a renewed world.</para>

  <para style="s1">Daniel Is Trained in Babylon</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="DAN 1:1"/>It was the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem. His armies surrounded the city and attacked it. <verse eid="DAN 1:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="DAN 1:2"/>The Lord handed Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, over to him. Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the objects from God’s temple. He carried them off to the temple of his god in Babylon. He put them among the treasures of his god.<verse eid="DAN 1:2"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="DAN 1:3"/>The king gave Ashpenaz an order. Ashpenaz was the chief of Nebuchadnezzar’s court officials. The king told him to bring him some of the Israelites. The king wanted them to serve him in his court. He wanted nobles and men from the royal family. <verse eid="DAN 1:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="DAN 1:4"/>He was looking for young men who were healthy and handsome. They had to be able to learn anything. They had to be well educated. They had to have the ability to understand new things quickly and easily. The king wanted men who could serve in his palace. Ashpenaz was supposed to teach them the Babylonian language and writings. <verse eid="DAN 1:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="DAN 1:5"/>The king had his servants give them food and wine from his own table. They received a certain amount every day. The young men had to be trained for three years. After that, they could begin to serve the king.<verse eid="DAN 1:5"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="DAN 1:6"/>Some of the men chosen were from Judah. Their names were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <verse eid="DAN 1:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="DAN 1:7"/>The chief official gave them new names. He gave Daniel the name Belteshazzar. He gave Hananiah the name Shadrach. He gave Mishael the name Meshach. And he gave Azariah the name Abednego.<verse eid="DAN 1:7"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" sid="DAN 1:8"/>Daniel decided not to make himself “unclean” by eating the king’s food and drinking his wine. So he asked the chief official for a favor. He wanted permission not to make himself “unclean” with the king’s food and wine. <verse eid="DAN 1:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="DAN 1:9"/>God had caused the official to be kind and friendly to Daniel. <verse eid="DAN 1:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="DAN 1:10"/>But the official refused to do what Daniel asked for. He said, “I’m afraid of the king. He is my master. He has decided what you and your three friends must eat and drink. Other young men are the same age as you. Why should he see you looking worse than them? When he sees how you look, he might kill me.”<verse eid="DAN 1:10"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="DAN 1:11"/>So Daniel spoke to one of the guards. The chief official had appointed him over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. <verse eid="DAN 1:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="DAN 1:12"/>Daniel said to him, “Please test us for ten days. Give us nothing but vegetables to eat. And give us only water to drink. <verse eid="DAN 1:12"/><verse number="13" style="v" sid="DAN 1:13"/>Then compare us with the young men who eat the king’s food. See how we look. After that, do what you want to.” <verse eid="DAN 1:13"/><verse number="14" style="v" sid="DAN 1:14"/>So the guard agreed. He tested them for ten days.<verse eid="DAN 1:14"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="DAN 1:15"/>After the ten days Daniel and his friends looked healthy and well fed. In fact, they looked better than any of the young men who ate the king’s food. <verse eid="DAN 1:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="DAN 1:16"/>So the guard didn’t require them to eat the king’s special food. He didn’t require them to drink the king’s wine either. He gave them vegetables instead.<verse eid="DAN 1:16"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="DAN 1:17"/>God gave knowledge and understanding to these four young men. So they understood all kinds of writings and subjects. And Daniel could understand all kinds of visions and dreams.<verse eid="DAN 1:17"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="18" style="v" sid="DAN 1:18"/>The three years the king had set for their training ended. So the chief official brought them to Nebuchadnezzar. <verse eid="DAN 1:18"/><verse number="19" style="v" sid="DAN 1:19"/>The king talked with them. He didn’t find anyone equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. So they began to serve the king. <verse eid="DAN 1:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="DAN 1:20"/>He asked them for advice in matters that required wisdom and understanding. The king always found their answers to be the best. Other men in his kingdom claimed to get knowledge by using magic. But the answers of Daniel and his friends were ten times better than theirs.<verse eid="DAN 1:20"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" sid="DAN 1:21"/>Daniel served in Babylon until the first year Cyrus ruled over the land of Babylon. Cyrus was king of Persia.<verse eid="DAN 1:21"/></para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="DAN 2:1"/>In the second year of Nebuchadnezzar’s rule, he had a dream. His mind was troubled. He couldn’t sleep. <verse eid="DAN 2:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="DAN 2:2"/>So the king sent for those who claimed to get knowledge by using magic. He also sent for those who practiced evil magic and those who studied the heavens. He wanted them to tell him what he had dreamed. They came in and stood in front of the king. <verse eid="DAN 2:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="DAN 2:3"/>He said to them, “I had a dream. It troubles me.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="10" style="v" sid="DAN 2:10"/>They answered the king, “There is no one on earth who can do what you are asking! No king has ever asked for anything like that. Not even a king as great and mighty as you has asked for it. Those who get knowledge by using magic have never been asked to do what you are asking. And those who study the heavens haven’t been asked to do it either. <verse eid="DAN 2:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="DAN 2:11"/>What you are asking is much too hard. No one can tell you what you dreamed except the gods. And they don’t live among human beings.”<verse eid="DAN 2:11"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="DAN 2:12"/>That made the king very angry.

So Daniel spoke to him wisely and carefully. <verse eid="DAN 2:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="DAN 2:15"/>He asked the king’s officer, “Why did Nebuchadnezzar give a terrible order like that?” Then Arioch explained to Daniel what was going on. <verse eid="DAN 2:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="DAN 2:16"/>When Daniel heard that, he went to the king.
