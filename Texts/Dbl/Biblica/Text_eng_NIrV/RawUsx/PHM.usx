  <para style="im">Philemon was a wealthy man who lived in the city of Colossae. There was a church that met in his home. Paul writes this letter to Philemon about a problem. The problem has to do with a man named Onesimus. Onesimus was originally from Colossae. He was a slave who belonged to Philemon. It seems that Onesimus had taken some things from Philemon and run away. He had gone all the way to Rome. But while in Rome, Onesimus met Paul and became a believer in Jesus. Paul was in prison and Onesimus had been helping him. Now Paul needed him to return to Colossae. Paul hoped that when Onesimus returned, Philemon would forgive him. Paul hoped Philemon would welcome Onesimus as a brother and not as a slave.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul’s letter to Philemon is brief. He tells Philemon about the important changes in Onesimus’ life. The name Onesimus means “useful” in Greek. Paul tells Philemon that Onesimus was “useless.” He was a slave who couldn’t be trusted. But Onesimus began to follow Jesus. Now he has become useful to both of them. Paul does not force Philemon to do anything. Paul bases his appeal to him on love. Paul promises to pay anything that Onesimus owes Philemon.</para>
  <para style="ip">Most likely Paul’s appeal was successful. Otherwise, this letter would not have been saved. The life of Onesimus is a clear example of how the good news about Jesus can change a person. This is the message that spread throughout the Roman Empire. And thousands of lives were changed.</para>

    <verse number="8" style="v" sid="PHM 1:8"/>Because of the authority Christ has given me, I could be bold. I could order you to do what you should do anyway. <verse eid="PHM 1:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="PHM 1:9"/>But we love each other. And I would rather appeal to you on the basis of that love. I, Paul, am an old man. I am now also a prisoner because of Christ Jesus. <verse eid="PHM 1:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="PHM 1:10"/>I am an old man, and I’m in prison. This is how I make my appeal to you for my son Onesimus. He became a son to me while I was being held in chains. <verse eid="PHM 1:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="PHM 1:11"/>Before that, he was useless to you.

And he could take your place in helping me. <verse eid="PHM 1:13"/><verse number="14" style="v" sid="PHM 1:14"/>But I didn’t want to do anything unless you agreed. Any favor you do must be done because you want to do it, not because you have to. <verse eid="PHM 1:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="PHM 1:15"/>Onesimus was separated from you for a little while. Maybe that was so you could have him back forever. <verse eid="PHM 1:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="PHM 1:16"/>You could have him back not as a slave. Instead, he would be better than a slave. He would be a dear brother. He is very dear to me but even more dear to you. He is dear to you not only as another human being. He is also dear to you as a brother in the Lord.<verse eid="PHM 1:16"/></para>

Then charge it to me. <verse eid="PHM 1:18"/><verse number="19" style="v" sid="PHM 1:19"/>I’ll pay it back. I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I won’t even mention that you owe me your life. <verse eid="PHM 1:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="PHM 1:20"/>My brother, we both belong to the Lord.
