  <para style="im">Paul wrote a second letter to the Thessalonians shortly after the first letter. Paul had to write to correct a false report about something he had said. Some believers thought Paul had said the day of the Lord had already come. The words “day of the Lord” are from the Old Testament prophets. These words are used to describe God’s victory over all of his enemies. And these words tell when his faithful followers will receive their reward. The Thessalonians were concerned about this. If that was so, they thought they could not expect anything better from God. Nothing more would be made right. And that was discouraging because they were suffering for their faith.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul begins by encouraging these believers in Thessalonica. He assures them God will pay back those who were giving them trouble. He goes on to remind them of details he had given them before. He had told them how the day of the Lord would arrive. Paul then repeats some instructions about how to live lives that please God. He tells them not to be lazy but to work hard. They are to earn their own living.</para>
  <para style="ip">The letter was most likely written by a scribe. The scribe would write as Paul spoke to him. But at the end of the letter, Paul adds a greeting in his own handwriting. He does this so the Thessalonians will know for sure these teachings come from him.</para>

    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="2TH 1:3"/>Brothers and sisters, we should always thank God for you. That is only right, because your faith is growing more and more.

  <para style="s1">The Man of Sin</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="2TH 2:1"/>Brothers and sisters, we want to ask you something. It has to do with the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. It concerns the time when we will go to be with him. <verse eid="2TH 2:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="2TH 2:2"/>What if you receive a message that is supposed to have come from us? What if it says that the day of the Lord has already come? If it does, we ask you not to become easily upset or alarmed. Don’t be upset whether that message is spoken or written or prophesied. <verse eid="2TH 2:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="2TH 2:3"/>Don’t let anyone trick you in any way. That day will not come until people rise up against God. It will not come until the man of sin appears. He is a marked man. He is headed for ruin. <verse eid="2TH 2:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2TH 2:4"/>He will oppose everything that is called God. He will oppose everything that is worshiped. He will give himself power over everything. He will set himself up in God’s temple. He will announce that he himself is God.<verse eid="2TH 2:4"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="2TH 2:5"/>Don’t you remember? When I was with you, I used to tell you these things. <verse eid="2TH 2:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2TH 2:6"/>Now you know what is holding back the man of sin. He is held back so that he can make his appearance at the right time. <verse eid="2TH 2:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2TH 2:7"/>The secret power of sin is already at work. But the one who now holds back that power will keep doing it until he is taken out of the way. <verse eid="2TH 2:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2TH 2:8"/>Then the man of sin will appear. The Lord Jesus will overthrow him with the breath of his mouth. The glorious brightness of Jesus’ coming will destroy the man of sin. <verse eid="2TH 2:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2TH 2:9"/>The coming of the man of sin will fit how Satan works. The man of sin will show his power through all kinds of signs and wonders. These signs and wonders will lead people astray. <verse eid="2TH 2:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2TH 2:10"/>So people who are dying will be fooled by this evil. These people are dying because they refuse to love the truth. The truth would save them. <verse eid="2TH 2:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2TH 2:11"/>So God will fool them completely. Then they will believe the lie. <verse eid="2TH 2:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2TH 2:12"/>Many will not believe the truth. They will take pleasure in evil. They will be judged.<verse eid="2TH 2:12"/></para>
