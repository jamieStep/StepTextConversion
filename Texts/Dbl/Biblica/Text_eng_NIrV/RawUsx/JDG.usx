    <verse number="4" style="v" sid="JDG 1:4"/>When the men of Judah attacked, the <char style="nd">Lord</char> helped them. He handed the Canaanites and Perizzites over to them.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="JDG 1:14"/>One day Aksah came to Othniel. She begged him to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?”<verse eid="JDG 1:14"/></para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="JDG 1:17"/>The men of Judah marched out with their fellow Israelites, the men of Simeon. They attacked the people of Canaan living in Zephath.

They also captured the territory around each of those cities.<verse eid="JDG 1:18"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" sid="JDG 1:19"/>The <char style="nd">Lord</char> was with the men of Judah. They took over the central hill country. But they weren’t able to drive the people out of the plains. That’s because those people used chariots that had some iron parts. <verse eid="JDG 1:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="JDG 1:20"/>Moses had promised to give Hebron to Caleb. So Hebron was given to Caleb. He drove the three sons of Anak out of it. <verse eid="JDG 1:20"/><verse number="21" style="v" sid="JDG 1:21"/>But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem.

That’s still its name to this day.<verse eid="JDG 1:26"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="27" style="v" sid="JDG 1:27"/>But the tribe of Manasseh didn’t drive out the people of Beth Shan. They didn’t drive out the people of Taanach, Dor, Ibleam and Megiddo. And they didn’t drive out the people of the settlements that are around those cities either. That’s because the Canaanites had made up their minds to continue living in that land. <verse eid="JDG 1:27"/><verse number="28" style="v" sid="JDG 1:28"/>Later, Israel became stronger. Then they forced the Canaanites to work hard for them. But Israel never drove them out completely. <verse eid="JDG 1:28"/><verse number="29" style="v" sid="JDG 1:29"/>The tribe of Ephraim didn’t drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer.

They didn’t drive out the people of Ahlab, Akzib, Helbah, Aphek and Rehob. <verse eid="JDG 1:31"/><verse number="32" style="v" sid="JDG 1:32"/>So the people of Asher lived among the Canaanites who were in the land. <verse eid="JDG 1:32"/><verse number="33" style="v" sid="JDG 1:33"/>The tribe of Naphtali didn’t drive out the people living in Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath.

They also stayed in Aijalon and Shaalbim. But the power of the tribes of Joseph grew.
