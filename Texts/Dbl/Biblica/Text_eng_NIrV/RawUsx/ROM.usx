  <para style="im">Paul wrote this letter to the believers who lived in Rome. He wrote them to ask for support. Paul wanted to bring the message about King Jesus to the western part of the Roman Empire. Paul’s job was to tell all people that Jesus is the world’s true ruler. In his message Paul shows that Jesus came from the family line of Israel’s King David. Paul’s message shows that God is faithful to his promise to Israel. Jesus the Messiah, or King, has come.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul’s letter to the Romans tells how Jesus’ death and resurrection saves the world. Paul presents this idea following the pattern of Israel’s story. It is the pattern of being in slavery and then being brought to freedom. All humans are being held as prisoners or slaves. That’s because sin and death came into the world. But Jesus came to set people free. He came to save both Jews and Gentiles from sin and death. He makes them into one new family of God. Jesus died and rose again. He broke the power of evil. Because of this the entire creation will be set free and made new.</para>
  <para style="ip">In the second part of his letter Paul tells how many people in Israel did not believe in Jesus. But God used this to help bring life to the rest of the world. Now both Jews and Gentiles can find true life through Jesus. It is the Holy Spirit that leads the way into this new way of living. The new family that follows Jesus can live in joy and peace because of what Jesus did.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="ROM 2:1"/>If you judge someone else, you have no excuse for it. When you judge another person, you are judging yourself. You do the same things you blame others for doing. <verse eid="ROM 2:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="ROM 2:2"/>We know that when God judges those who do evil things, he judges fairly. <verse eid="ROM 2:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="ROM 2:3"/>Though you are only a human being, you judge others. But you yourself do the same things. So how do you think you will escape when God judges you? <verse eid="ROM 2:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="ROM 2:4"/>Do you disrespect God’s great kindness and favor?

    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="ROM 2:5"/>But you are stubborn. In your heart you are not sorry for your sins. You are storing up anger against yourself. The day of God’s anger is coming.

They want glory, honor, and life that never ends. <verse eid="ROM 2:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="ROM 2:8"/>But there are others who only look out for themselves. They don’t accept the truth. They go astray. God will pour out his great anger on them. <verse eid="ROM 2:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="ROM 2:9"/>There will be trouble and suffering for everyone who does evil. That is meant first for the Jews. It is also meant for the Gentiles. <verse eid="ROM 2:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="ROM 2:10"/>But there will be glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="ROM 2:12"/>Some people do not know God’s law when they sin. They will not be judged by the law when they die. Others do know God’s law when they sin. They will be judged by the law. <verse eid="ROM 2:12"/><verse number="13" style="v" sid="ROM 2:13"/>Hearing the law does not make a person right with God. People are considered to be right with God only when they obey the law. <verse eid="ROM 2:13"/><verse number="14" style="v" sid="ROM 2:14"/>Gentiles do not have the law. Sometimes they just naturally do what the law requires. They are a law for themselves. This is true even though they don’t have the law. <verse eid="ROM 2:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="ROM 2:15"/>They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts. The way their minds judge them proves this fact. Sometimes their thoughts find them guilty. At other times their thoughts find them not guilty. <verse eid="ROM 2:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="ROM 2:16"/>This will happen on the day God appoints Jesus Christ to judge people’s secret thoughts.

And true circumcision means that the heart has been circumcised by the Holy Spirit. The person whose heart has been circumcised does more than obey the written law.
