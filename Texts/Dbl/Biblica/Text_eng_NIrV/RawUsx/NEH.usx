    <verse number="31" style="v" sid="NEH 12:31"/>I, Nehemiah, had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall. I also appointed two large choirs to sing and give thanks.

Those gifts included the first shares of their crops. They also included a tenth of everything the Law required. Crops were harvested from the fields around the towns. The people had to bring the shares of those crops that were required by the Law. They gave them to the priests and Levites. That’s because the people of Judah were pleased with the priests and Levites who were serving God. <verse eid="NEH 12:44"/><verse number="45" style="v" sid="NEH 12:45"/>The priests and Levites did everything their God wanted them to do. They made things pure and “clean.” The musicians and the men who guarded the temple gates also served God. Everything was done just as David and his son Solomon had commanded. <verse eid="NEH 12:45"/><verse number="46" style="v" sid="NEH 12:46"/>A long time ago there had been directors for the musicians.

They gave the musicians and the men who guarded the gates what they were supposed to give them every day. They also set apart the shares for the other Levites.
