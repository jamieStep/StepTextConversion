  <para style="im">Jude and James were brothers of Jesus. James was a leader in the church in Jerusalem. He was the writer of the book of James. Jude also had authority as a leader in the church. Jude most likely wrote this letter to Jewish believers. This letter would have special meaning for these believers. That’s because it talks about Israel’s history and about angels. And it talks about other writings that would have meaning for them.</para>
  <para style="ip">Jude speaks about the problem of false teachers in the church. They are teaching against the true faith. These false teachers claim they have had inspired dreams. They reject the authority of the church leaders. And they use their bodies in unholy ways. These false teachers claim that they are bringing God’s message. But they don’t show that they have the spirit of God in them. They live following their own ungodly desires. Jude warns the believers to actively resist these false teachers. He tells them to clean out their community by saying no to these false teachings.</para>
  <para style="ip">It seems that the apostle Peter received a copy of Jude’s letter. Peter then wrote a letter of his own. Peter’s letter supported what Jude had said. It stated that Jude had faithfully presented the teachings of Jesus’ own apostles.</para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="JUD 1:3"/>Dear friends, I really wanted to write to you about the salvation we share. But now I feel I should write and ask you to stand up for the faith. God’s holy people were trusted with it once and for all time. <verse eid="JUD 1:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="JUD 1:4"/>Certain people have secretly slipped in among you. Long ago it was written that they would be judged. They are ungodly people. They misuse the grace of our God as an excuse for sexual sins. They say no to Jesus Christ, our only Lord and King.<verse eid="JUD 1:4"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="JUD 1:5"/>I want to remind you about some things you already know. The Lord saved his people. At one time he brought them out of Egypt. But later he destroyed those who did not believe. <verse eid="JUD 1:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="JUD 1:6"/>Some of the angels didn’t stay where they belonged. They didn’t keep their positions of authority. The Lord has kept those angels in darkness. They are held by chains that last forever. On judgment day, God will judge them. <verse eid="JUD 1:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="JUD 1:7"/>The people of Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them also did evil things. They freely committed sexual sins. They committed sins of the worst possible kind. There is a fire that never goes out. Those people are an example of those who are punished with it.<verse eid="JUD 1:7"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="8" style="v" sid="JUD 1:8"/>In the very same way, these ungodly people act on their evil dreams. So they make their own bodies impure. They don’t accept authority. And they say evil things against heavenly beings. <verse eid="JUD 1:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="JUD 1:9"/>But even Michael, the leader of the angels, didn’t dare to say these things. He didn’t even say these things when he argued with the devil about the body of Moses. Michael didn’t dare to judge the devil. He didn’t say the devil was guilty of saying evil things. Instead, Michael said, “May the Lord judge you!” <verse eid="JUD 1:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="JUD 1:10"/>But these people say evil things against whatever they don’t understand. And the very things they do understand will destroy them. That’s because they are like wild animals that can’t think for themselves. Instead, they do what comes naturally to them.<verse eid="JUD 1:10"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="JUD 1:11"/>How terrible it will be for them! They have followed the way of Cain. They have rushed into the same mistake Balaam made. They did it because they loved money. They are like Korah. He turned against his leaders. These people will certainly be destroyed, just as Korah was.<verse eid="JUD 1:11"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="JUD 1:12"/>These ungodly people are like stains at the meals you share. They have no shame. They are shepherds who feed only themselves. They are like clouds without rain. They are blown along by the wind. They are like trees in the fall. Since they have no fruit, they are pulled out of the ground. So they die twice. <verse eid="JUD 1:12"/><verse number="13" style="v" sid="JUD 1:13"/>They are like wild waves of the sea. Their shame rises up like foam. They are like falling stars. God has reserved a place of very black darkness for them forever.<verse eid="JUD 1:13"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="JUD 1:14"/>Enoch was the seventh man in the family line of Adam. He gave a prophecy about these people. He said, “Look! The Lord is coming with thousands and thousands of his holy ones. <verse eid="JUD 1:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="JUD 1:15"/>He is coming to judge everyone. He is coming to sentence all of them. He will judge them for all the ungodly acts they have done. They have done them in ungodly ways. He will sentence ungodly sinners for all the things they have said to oppose him.” <verse eid="JUD 1:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="JUD 1:16"/>These people complain and find fault with others. They follow their own evil desires. They brag about themselves. They praise others to get what they want.<verse eid="JUD 1:16"/></para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="JUD 1:17"/>Dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said would happen. <verse eid="JUD 1:17"/><verse number="18" style="v" sid="JUD 1:18"/>They told you, “In the last days, some people will make fun of the truth. They will follow their own ungodly desires.” <verse eid="JUD 1:18"/><verse number="19" style="v" sid="JUD 1:19"/>They are the people who separate you from one another.
