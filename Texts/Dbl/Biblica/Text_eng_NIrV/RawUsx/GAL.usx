  <para style="im">Galatia was a region located in Asia Minor. It was part of the Roman Empire. Paul visited Galatia three different times when he traveled. When he was there, Paul spoke to the people about the good news of Jesus the Messiah. The people of Galatia gladly received Paul and his message of the good news. But later other leaders and teachers came to Galatia. They challenged Paul’s leadership. And they challenged the authority of Paul’s teaching. So, Paul wrote this letter to believers in Galatia. In this letter Paul shows he has the right to teach the good news. He also shows that he is teaching the true good news. He states that faith in Jesus Christ is all that is needed. Membership in God’s new community is by faith alone.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul begins his letter by stating that he has the right to preach the good news. He says that he did not receive the good news from human beings. He says he received that good news from Jesus himself. Paul also states that other apostles support him in his work.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul then moves to the main point of the letter. Paul states that Gentile believers don’t have to follow all the laws of the Jews. They are members of the new community of believers because they believe in Jesus. This community fulfills God’s promise that Abraham would have a worldwide family. The Bible’s story has been pointing to this all along.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul ends the letter by reminding the Galatians that they live by the power of the Holy Spirit. Following Jewish laws is not what matters. “What really counts is that the new creation has come.”</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="GAL 1:1"/>I, Paul, am writing this letter. I am an apostle. People have not sent me. No human authority has sent me.

    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="GAL 1:6"/>I am amazed. You are so quickly deserting the one who chose you. He chose you to live in the grace that Christ has provided. You are turning to a different “good news.” <verse eid="GAL 1:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="GAL 1:7"/>What you are accepting is really not the good news at all. It seems that some people have gotten you all mixed up. They are trying to twist the good news about Christ. <verse eid="GAL 1:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="GAL 1:8"/>But suppose even we should preach a different “good news.” Suppose even an angel from heaven should preach it. Suppose it is different from the good news we gave you. Then let anyone who does that be cursed by God. <verse eid="GAL 1:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="GAL 1:9"/>I have already said it.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="GAL 1:11"/>Brothers and sisters, here is what I want you to know. The good news I preached does not come from human beings. <verse eid="GAL 1:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="GAL 1:12"/>No one gave it to me. No one taught it to me. Instead, I received it from Jesus Christ. He showed it to me.<verse eid="GAL 1:12"/></para>

    <verse number="13" style="v" sid="GAL 1:13"/>You have heard how I lived earlier in my Jewish way of life. With all my strength I attacked the church of God. I tried to destroy it. <verse eid="GAL 1:13"/><verse number="14" style="v" sid="GAL 1:14"/>I was moving ahead in my Jewish way of life. I went beyond many of my people who were my own age. I held firmly to the teachings passed down by my people. <verse eid="GAL 1:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="GAL 1:15"/>But God set me apart from before the time I was born. He showed me his grace by appointing me. He was pleased <verse eid="GAL 1:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="GAL 1:16"/>to show his Son in my life. He wanted me to preach about Jesus among the Gentiles. When God appointed me, I decided right away not to ask anyone for advice. <verse eid="GAL 1:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="GAL 1:17"/>I didn’t go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went into Arabia. Later I returned to Damascus.<verse eid="GAL 1:17"/></para>

    <verse number="18" style="v" sid="GAL 1:18"/>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem. I went there to get to know Peter. I stayed with him for 15 days. <verse eid="GAL 1:18"/><verse number="19" style="v" sid="GAL 1:19"/>I didn’t see any of the other apostles. I only saw James, the Lord’s brother. <verse eid="GAL 1:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="GAL 1:20"/>Here is what you can be sure of. And God is even a witness to it.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="GAL 2:1"/>Then after fourteen years, I went up again to Jerusalem. This time I went with Barnabas. I took Titus along also. <verse eid="GAL 2:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="GAL 2:2"/>I went because God showed me what he wanted me to do. I spoke in private to those who are respected as leaders. I told them the good news that I preach among the Gentiles. I wanted to be sure I wasn’t running my race for no purpose. And I wanted to know that I had not been running my race for no purpose. <verse eid="GAL 2:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="GAL 2:3"/>Titus was with me. He was a Greek. But even he was not forced to be circumcised. <verse eid="GAL 2:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="GAL 2:4"/>This matter came up because some people had slipped in among us. They had pretended to be believers. They wanted to find out about the freedom we have because we belong to Christ Jesus. They wanted to make us slaves again. <verse eid="GAL 2:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="GAL 2:5"/>We didn’t give in to them for a moment. We did this so that the truth of the good news would be kept safe for you.<verse eid="GAL 2:5"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="6" style="v" sid="GAL 2:6"/>Some people in Jerusalem were thought to be important. But it makes no difference to me what they were. God does not treat people differently. Those people added nothing to my message. <verse eid="GAL 2:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="GAL 2:7"/>In fact, it was just the opposite. They recognized the task I had been trusted with. It was the task of preaching the good news to the Gentiles. My task was like Peter’s task. He had been trusted with the task of preaching to the Jews. <verse eid="GAL 2:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="GAL 2:8"/>God was working in Peter as an apostle to the Jews. God was also working in me as an apostle to the Gentiles. <verse eid="GAL 2:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="GAL 2:9"/>James, Peter and John are respected as pillars in the church. They recognized the special grace given to me. So they shook my hand and the hand of Barnabas. They wanted to show they accepted us. They agreed that we should go to the Gentiles. They would go to the Jews. <verse eid="GAL 2:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="GAL 2:10"/>They asked only one thing. They wanted us to continue to remember poor people. That was what I had wanted to do all along.<verse eid="GAL 2:10"/></para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="11" style="v" sid="GAL 2:11"/>When Peter came to Antioch, I told him to his face that I was against what he was doing. He was clearly wrong. <verse eid="GAL 2:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="GAL 2:12"/>He used to eat with the Gentiles. But certain men came from a group sent by James. When they arrived, Peter began to draw back. He separated himself from the Gentiles. That’s because he was afraid of the circumcision group sent by James. <verse eid="GAL 2:12"/><verse number="13" style="v" sid="GAL 2:13"/>Peter’s actions were not honest, and other Jews in Antioch joined him. Even Barnabas was led astray.<verse eid="GAL 2:13"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="14" style="v" sid="GAL 2:14"/>I saw what they were doing. It was not in line with the truth of the good news. So I spoke to Peter in front of them all. “You are a Jew,” I said. “But you live like one who is not. So why do you force Gentiles to follow Jewish ways?”<verse eid="GAL 2:14"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="GAL 2:15"/>We are Jews by birth. We are not sinful Gentiles. <verse eid="GAL 2:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="GAL 2:16"/>Here is what we know. No one is made right with God by obeying the law. It is by believing in Jesus Christ. So we too have put our faith in Christ Jesus. This is so we can be made right with God by believing in Christ. We are not made right by obeying the law. That’s because no one can be made right with God by obeying the law.<verse eid="GAL 2:16"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="17" style="v" sid="GAL 2:17"/>We are seeking to be made right with God through Christ. As we do, what if we find that we who are Jews are also sinners? Does that mean that Christ causes us to sin? Certainly not! <verse eid="GAL 2:17"/><verse number="18" style="v" sid="GAL 2:18"/>Suppose I build again what I had destroyed. Then I would really be breaking the law.<verse eid="GAL 2:18"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" sid="GAL 2:19"/>By the law, I died as far as the law is concerned. I died so that I might live for God. <verse eid="GAL 2:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="GAL 2:20"/>I have been crucified with Christ. I don’t live any longer, but Christ lives in me. Now I live my life in my body by faith in the Son of God. He loved me and gave himself for me. <verse eid="GAL 2:20"/><verse number="21" style="v" sid="GAL 2:21"/>I do not get rid of the grace of God.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="GAL 3:1"/>You foolish people of Galatia! Who has put you under an evil spell? When I preached, I clearly showed you that Jesus Christ had been nailed to the cross. <verse eid="GAL 3:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="GAL 3:2"/>I would like to learn just one thing from you. Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law? Or did you receive the Spirit by believing what you heard? <verse eid="GAL 3:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="GAL 3:3"/>Are you so foolish? You began by the Holy Spirit. Are you now trying to finish God’s work in you by your own strength? <verse eid="GAL 3:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="GAL 3:4"/>Have you experienced so much for nothing? And was it really for nothing? <verse eid="GAL 3:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="GAL 3:5"/>So I ask you again, how does God give you his Spirit? How does he work miracles among you? Is it by doing what the law says? Or is it by believing what you have heard? <verse eid="GAL 3:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="GAL 3:6"/>In the same way, Abraham “believed God.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" sid="GAL 3:7"/>So you see, those who have faith are children of Abraham. <verse eid="GAL 3:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="GAL 3:8"/>Long ago, Scripture knew that God would make the Gentiles right with himself. He would do this by their faith in him. He announced the good news ahead of time to Abraham. God said, “All nations will be blessed because of you.” <char style="rq">(<ref loc="GEN 12:3">Genesis 12:3</ref>; <ref loc="GEN 18:18">18:18</ref>; <ref loc="GEN 22:18">22:18</ref>)</char> <verse eid="GAL 3:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="GAL 3:9"/>So those who depend on faith are blessed along with Abraham.

He did it so that we might receive the promise of the Holy Spirit. The promised Spirit comes by believing in Christ.<verse eid="GAL 3:14"/></para>
  <para style="s1">The Law and the Promise</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="GAL 3:15"/>Brothers and sisters, let me give you an example from everyday life. No one can get rid of an official agreement between people. No one can add to it. It can’t be changed after it has been made. It is the same with God’s covenant agreement. <verse eid="GAL 3:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="GAL 3:16"/>The promises were given to Abraham. They were also given to his seed. Scripture does not say, “and to seeds.” That means many people. It says, “and to your seed.” <char style="rq">(<ref loc="GEN 12:7">Genesis 12:7</ref>; <ref loc="GEN 13:15">13:15</ref>; <ref loc="GEN 24:7">24:7</ref>)</char> That means one person. And that one person is Christ. <verse eid="GAL 3:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="GAL 3:17"/>Here is what I mean. The law came 430 years after the promise. But the law does not get rid of God’s covenant and promise. The covenant had already been made by God. So the law does not do away with the promise. <verse eid="GAL 3:17"/><verse number="18" style="v" sid="GAL 3:18"/>The great gift that God has for us does not depend on the law. If it did, it would no longer depend on the promise. But God gave it to Abraham as a free gift through a promise.<verse eid="GAL 3:18"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="19" style="v" sid="GAL 3:19"/>Then why was the law given at all? It was added because of human sin. And it was supposed to control us until the promised Seed had come. The law was given through angels, and a go-between was put in charge of it. <verse eid="GAL 3:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="GAL 3:20"/>A go-between means that there is more than one side to an agreement. But God didn’t use a go-between when he made his promise to Abraham.<verse eid="GAL 3:20"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="21" style="v" sid="GAL 3:21"/>So is the law opposed to God’s promises? Certainly not! What if a law had been given that could give life? Then people could become right with God by obeying the law. <verse eid="GAL 3:21"/><verse number="22" style="v" sid="GAL 3:22"/>But Scripture has locked up everything under the control of sin. It does so in order that what was promised might be given to those who believe. The promise comes through faith in Jesus Christ.<verse eid="GAL 3:22"/></para>
  <para style="s1">Children of God</para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="23" style="v" sid="GAL 3:23"/>Before faith in Christ came, we were guarded by the law. We were locked up until this faith was made known. <verse eid="GAL 3:23"/><verse number="24" style="v" sid="GAL 3:24"/>So the law was put in charge of us until Christ came. He came so that we might be made right with God by believing in Christ. <verse eid="GAL 3:24"/><verse number="25" style="v" sid="GAL 3:25"/>But now faith in Christ has come. So the law is no longer in charge of us.<verse eid="GAL 3:25"/></para>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="26" style="v" sid="GAL 3:26"/>So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God by believing in Christ. <verse eid="GAL 3:26"/><verse number="27" style="v" sid="GAL 3:27"/>This is because all of you who were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. You have put him on as if he were your clothes. <verse eid="GAL 3:27"/><verse number="28" style="v" sid="GAL 3:28"/>There is no Jew or Gentile. There is no slave or free person. There is no male or female. That’s because you are all one in Christ Jesus. <verse eid="GAL 3:28"/><verse number="29" style="v" sid="GAL 3:29"/>You who belong to Christ are Abraham’s seed. So you will receive what God has promised.<verse eid="GAL 3:29"/></para>

  <chapter number="4" style="c" sid="GAL 4"/>
  <para style="p">
    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="GAL 4:1"/>Here is what I have been saying. As long as your own children are young, they are no different from slaves in your house. They are no different, even though they will own all the property. <verse eid="GAL 4:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="GAL 4:2"/>People are in charge of the property. And other people are in charge of the children. The children remain under their care until they become adults. At that time their fathers give them the property. <verse eid="GAL 4:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="GAL 4:3"/>It is the same with us. When we were children, we were slaves to the basic spiritual powers of the world. <verse eid="GAL 4:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="GAL 4:4"/>But then the chosen time came. God sent his Son. A woman gave birth to him. He was born under the authority of the law. <verse eid="GAL 4:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="GAL 4:5"/>He came to set free those who were under the authority of the law. He wanted us to be adopted as children with all the rights children have. <verse eid="GAL 4:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="GAL 4:6"/>Because you are his children, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts. He is the Holy Spirit. By his power we call God <char style="tl">Abba</char>. Abba means Father. <verse eid="GAL 4:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="GAL 4:7"/>So you aren’t a slave any longer.
