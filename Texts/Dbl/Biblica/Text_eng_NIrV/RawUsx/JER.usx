  <para style="im">Jeremiah was a prophet. He spoke to the Israelites who lived in the nation of Judah. He began speaking in Judah when Josiah was king. And he continued to speak until Judah was destroyed by the nation of Babylon. That was about 40 years. The book of Jeremiah is a mix of his sermons and poems. There are also many stories of his personal life experiences.</para>
  <para style="ip">This book gives us a personal look into Jeremiah’s own heart. The people of Judah were his family and his own nation. Yet, they turned away from him. And they even made a plan to kill him.</para>
  <para style="ip">The book of Jeremiah begins and ends with a message about the fall of Jerusalem. The book has four main sections. It begins with a section of speeches written as poems. This is followed by two sections of regular speeches. And it ends with another section of poetic speeches. There is a long poem in the middle of the regular speech section. Each section ends by saying that Jeremiah’s words were written on a scroll.</para>
  <para style="ip">Jeremiah’s prophecies are at the beginning, middle and end of the book. That shows how important they are. The middle poem is the most important. In that speech a new agreement between God and his people is promised. The speech tells that God will do more than simply punish evil. He will overcome evil with good. God will change the human heart. And God will have a new agreement with his people.</para>
  <para style="ip">The themes in the book of Jeremiah stay the same. There is the message of judgment for doing what is wrong. That is followed by the message of forgiveness. The biggest message is that God will make all things new. And that leads to new life.</para>
