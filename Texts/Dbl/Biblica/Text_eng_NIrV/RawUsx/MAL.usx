  <para style="im">The rebuilding of the temple was done 516 years before Jesus the Messiah was born. The temple was completed while Zerubbabel was governor and Joshua was high priest. During that time the people were encouraged by the prophecies of Haggai and Zechariah. The new temple was meant to be the center of the community of God’s people. True worship of God would be found there. And the people would be fair and would show mercy to others. In this way Israel would obey its calling. It would be a light revealing God to the nations.</para>
  <para style="ip">But after many years passed the people fell further and further from God. Their worship became false. Their community became unjust and unfair to others. So the prophet Malachi came to challenge the people. Malachi’s name means “my messenger.” He told the people to honor God with true worship. He asks them to be honest in their dealings with others. If they do these things, they will be true to their calling. Then the world could come to know the <char style="nd">Lord</char> as the great king.</para>
  <para style="ip">Malachi begins his messages by bringing a charge against the people. The people try to answer the charge. Then Malachi responds to what the people have said. In response to Malachi, some of the people repent. God tells them he will save anyone who loves and respects him. This will happen when he comes to judge the earth.</para>
  <para style="ip">The book of Malachi ends with God’s promise. God promises to send the prophet Elijah before the day of the <char style="nd">Lord</char> arrives. And that will be a great and terrible day.</para>
