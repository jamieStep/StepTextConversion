  <para style="im">After Paul had been freed from prison in Rome he heard there were problems in the church at Ephesus. Some leaders in Ephesus had changed the message of the good news. They changed the message Paul had preached to them. These leaders misused the Jewish law by limiting the foods people could eat. These leaders also taught wrong ideas about how to grow spiritually. And they used some practices from the worldly beliefs of that day. These false leaders even allowed immoral behavior.</para>
  <para style="ip">So Paul sent Timothy to Ephesus and wrote him a letter. Paul wanted Timothy to share the letter with the believers there. Paul hoped the letter would give Timothy the power and authority to set things right. Timothy would have to be in charge until Paul could come himself.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul writes in this letter about leadership in the church. He describes what true leadership looks like. This would help the Ephesians say no to those who weren’t qualified to lead. And they would know how to choose those who were. Paul includes a special warning near the end of the letter. He warns about the dangers of being greedy. Paul wants them to know it is important to not trust money. God is the one we can trust.</para>
  <para style="ip">Throughout the letter Paul uses the phrase “Christ Jesus” meaning “Jesus the Messiah.” Paul wants to point out that Jesus rules as King. This would help remind the church that Jesus was their real leader. And Jesus the Messiah was and is the best example of true leadership.</para>

    <verse number="3" style="v" sid="1TI 1:3"/>Timothy, stay there in Ephesus. That is what I told you to do when I went into Macedonia. I want you to command certain people not to teach things that aren’t true. <verse eid="1TI 1:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="1TI 1:4"/>And command them not to spend their time on stories that are made up. They must not waste time on family histories that never end. These things only lead to fights about ideas. They don’t help God’s work move forward. His work is done by faith. <verse eid="1TI 1:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="1TI 1:5"/>Love is the purpose of my command. Love comes from a pure heart. It comes from a good sense of what is right and wrong. It comes from faith that is honest and true. <verse eid="1TI 1:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="1TI 1:6"/>Some have turned from these teachings. They would rather talk about things that have no meaning. <verse eid="1TI 1:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="1TI 1:7"/>They want to be teachers of the law. And they are very sure about that law.

It is made for those who break the law. It is for those who refuse to obey. It is for ungodly and sinful people. It is for those who aren’t holy and who don’t believe. It is for those who kill their fathers or mothers. It is for murderers. <verse eid="1TI 1:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="1TI 1:10"/>It is for those who commit sexual sins. It is for those who commit homosexual acts. It is for people who buy and sell slaves. It is for liars. It is for people who tell lies in court. It is for those who are a witness to things that aren’t true. And it is for anything else that is the opposite of true teaching. <verse eid="1TI 1:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="1TI 1:11"/>True teaching agrees with the good news about the glory of the blessed God.

I really pushed them around. But God showed me mercy anyway. I did those things without knowing any better. I wasn’t a believer. <verse eid="1TI 1:13"/><verse number="14" style="v" sid="1TI 1:14"/>Our Lord poured out more and more of his grace on me.

    <verse number="15" style="v" sid="1TI 1:15"/>Here is a saying that you can trust. It should be accepted completely. Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners. And I am the worst sinner of all. <verse eid="1TI 1:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="1TI 1:16"/>But for that very reason, God showed me mercy. And I am the worst of sinners. He showed me mercy so that Christ Jesus could show that he is very patient. I was an example for those who would come to believe in him. Then they would receive eternal life. <verse eid="1TI 1:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="1TI 1:17"/>The eternal King will never die. He can’t be seen. He is the only God.

You will hold on to a good sense of what is right and wrong. Some have not accepted this knowledge of right and wrong. So they have destroyed their faith. They are like a ship that has sunk. <verse eid="1TI 1:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="1TI 1:20"/>Hymenaeus and Alexander are among them. I have handed them over to Satan. That will teach them not to speak evil things against God.<verse eid="1TI 1:20"/></para>
