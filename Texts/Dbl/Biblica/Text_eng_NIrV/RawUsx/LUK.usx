  <para style="im">Luke wrote a two-part story of Jesus and the early Christians. These two parts are called Luke and Acts. They tell how God first invited the people of Israel to follow Jesus. And then later people from all nations are invited to follow him. In the book of Luke the story moves to Jerusalem. Jerusalem is the center of Israel’s national life. In the book of Acts the story moves from Jerusalem to other nations. In the end a man named Paul preaches about the kingdom of God to the people living in Rome. Rome is the capital of the Roman Empire.</para>
  <para style="ip">Luke writes his books for a Roman official named Theophilus. Luke wants Theophilus and others who are not Jews to know the story of Jesus. Luke wants everyone to know that God’s saving plan is being fulfilled. Through his chosen people Israel, a light was brought into the world. Jesus the Messiah has come to all people. He has conquered sin and death. And now his followers are bringing this message about Jesus to all the nations.</para>
  <para style="ip">The Gospel of Luke has three main parts:</para>
  <para style="ip">First, Jesus does his work in Galilee, the northern area in the land of Israel.</para>
  <para style="ip">Second, Jesus takes a long journey to Jerusalem. Along the way he tells people about the kingdom of God. And he shows what life is like when God rules the world.</para>
  <para style="ip">Third, Luke tells how Jesus gave his life for others in Jerusalem. Then Jesus rises from the dead and sends his followers to tell the world about him.</para>

    <verse number="1" style="v" sid="LUK 1:1"/>Many people have attempted to write about the things that have taken place among us. <verse eid="LUK 1:1"/><verse number="2" style="v" sid="LUK 1:2"/>Reports of these things were handed down to us.

So I also decided to write down an orderly report of exactly what happened.
