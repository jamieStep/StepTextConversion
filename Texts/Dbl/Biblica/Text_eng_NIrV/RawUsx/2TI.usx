  <para style="im">Paul’s helper Timothy was in the church at Ephesus. Timothy had to deal with some of the church’s leaders. These leaders were teaching things that were not true. When Timothy struggled with this problem, Paul came back to Ephesus. Paul suffered a great deal of harm there. This was from Alexander who was one of these false leaders. Because of what Alexander did, Paul was once again taken as a prisoner. Paul was sent to Rome. And this time Paul expected there would be a trial and he would be killed. So Paul wrote to Timothy asking him to come quickly to Rome.</para>
  <para style="ip">The two leaders who opposed Paul were named Alexander and Hymenaeus. These men were leading the believers into a false understanding of the faith. Their teaching encouraged arguing rather than faithful living. Paul ordered both Alexander and Hymenaeus to not be leaders any more. But they continued to oppose Paul. Then other people joined with them to oppose Paul.</para>
  <para style="ip">Timothy was discouraged by what had happened. So Paul wrote this letter to encourage Timothy to be faithful to the true message. Paul told Timothy to be faithful even if it means suffering or death. He reminds Timothy there will trouble and suffering before Jesus comes again as king. Paul states that there will be false teachers. They will challenge the faithfulness of God’s people.</para>
  <para style="ip">Paul encourages Timothy to remember the good news. The message is that Jesus Christ died and rose again from the dead. Jesus is the promised Messiah from the family line of David. Paul reminds Timothy that the sacred writings come from God. Timothy has known those writings since he was a child. Knowing this will help Timothy continue doing the good work he was called to do.</para>

I was appointed to be an apostle and a teacher. <verse eid="2TI 1:11"/><verse number="12" style="v" sid="2TI 1:12"/>That’s why I’m suffering the way I am. But this gives me no reason to be ashamed.
