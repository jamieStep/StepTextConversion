  <para style="im">In 1 Corinthians Paul writes about his personal struggles with the believers in Corinth. That relationship was not easy and sometimes unpleasant. In 2 Corinthians Paul continues to speak to these believers about their problems and struggles.</para>
  <para style="ip">In this letter Paul tells them they are part of God’s new world. But they live in the old world that is still fighting against God. So they will have problems as followers of Jesus. Paul writes about many practical issues. Paul tells them why he must change his plans to visit them. He tells them how to collect money as a gift for the very poor people in Jerusalem. Finally, Paul tells them to not believe false teachers. He tells these believers that he has been true to them. And that he brought the true message of good news to them.</para>
  <para style="ip">As Paul writes this book, he sees himself in different places. In each setting Paul thinks about his relationship with the people in Corinth. Paul either recalls or looks forward to something in his relationship with them. There is a main theme connecting all the parts of the book. The theme is that God will bring comfort in the time of trouble. So believers everywhere must also offer this comfort to each other. Jesus’ life was an example of this. Jesus suffered first and then was comforted. And so his life is an example for us. We are weak and suffer. But we live in the power of God through Jesus Christ. And that is our comfort.</para>
  <para style="ip">In the final section of the book, Paul challenges the people in Corinth. They must not believe the false teachers who have come there. Then Paul ends the letter with hope. He asks the people to rejoice in God’s grace, love and fellowship.</para>

All comfort comes from him. <verse eid="2CO 1:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2CO 1:4"/>He comforts us in all our troubles. Now we can comfort others when they are in trouble. We ourselves receive comfort from God. <verse eid="2CO 1:4"/><verse number="5" style="v" sid="2CO 1:5"/>We share very much in the sufferings of Christ. So we also share very much in his comfort. <verse eid="2CO 1:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 1:6"/>If we are having trouble, it is so that you will be comforted and renewed. If we are comforted, it is so that you will be comforted.

It was far more than we could stand. We even thought we were going to die. <verse eid="2CO 1:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 1:9"/>In fact, we felt as if we were under the sentence of death. But that happened so that we would not depend on ourselves but on God. He raises the dead to life. <verse eid="2CO 1:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 1:10"/>God has saved us from deadly dangers. And he will continue to do it. We have put our hope in him.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 1:12"/>Here is what we take pride in. Our sense of what is right and wrong tells us how we have acted. We have lived with honor and godly honesty. We have depended on God’s grace and not on the world’s wisdom. We lived that way most of all when we were dealing with you. <verse eid="2CO 1:12"/><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2CO 1:13"/>We are writing only what you can read and understand.

I would have come back to you from there. Then you would have sent me on my way to Judea. <verse eid="2CO 1:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 1:17"/>When I planned all this, was I ready to change my mind for no good reason? No. I don’t make my plans the way the world makes theirs. In the same breath the world says both, “Yes! Yes!” and “No! No!”<verse eid="2CO 1:17"/></para>

Our message did not say “Yes” and “No” at the same time. The message of Christ has always been “Yes.” <verse eid="2CO 1:19"/><verse number="20" style="v" sid="2CO 1:20"/>God has made a great many promises. They are all “Yes” because of what Christ has done. So through Christ we say “Amen.” We want God to receive glory. <verse eid="2CO 1:20"/><verse number="21" style="v" sid="2CO 1:21"/>He makes both us and you remain strong in the faith because we belong to Christ. He anointed us. <verse eid="2CO 1:21"/><verse number="22" style="v" sid="2CO 1:22"/>He put his Spirit in our hearts and marked us as his own.

Only you, the people I made sad. <verse eid="2CO 2:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="2CO 2:3"/>What I wrote to you I wrote for a special reason.

I was sure that all of you would share my joy. <verse eid="2CO 2:3"/><verse number="4" style="v" sid="2CO 2:4"/>I was very troubled when I wrote to you. My heart was sad. My eyes were full of tears.

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="5" style="v" sid="2CO 2:5"/>Suppose someone has made us sad. In some ways, he hasn’t made me sad so much as he has made all of you sad. But I don’t want to put this too strongly. <verse eid="2CO 2:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 2:6"/>He has been punished because most of you decided he should be. This punishment is enough. <verse eid="2CO 2:6"/><verse number="7" style="v" sid="2CO 2:7"/>Now you should forgive him and comfort him. Then he won’t be sad more than he can stand. <verse eid="2CO 2:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2CO 2:8"/>So I’m asking you to tell him again that you still love him. <verse eid="2CO 2:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 2:9"/>I wrote to you for another special reason. I wanted to see if you could stand the test. I wanted to see if you could obey everything asked of you. <verse eid="2CO 2:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 2:10"/>Anyone you forgive I also forgive. Was there anything to forgive? If so, I have forgiven it for your benefit, knowing that Christ is watching. <verse eid="2CO 2:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 2:11"/>We don’t want Satan to outsmart us.

    <verse number="12" style="v" sid="2CO 2:12"/>I went to Troas to preach the good news about Christ. There I found that the Lord had opened a door of opportunity for me. <verse eid="2CO 2:12"/><verse number="13" style="v" sid="2CO 2:13"/>But I still had no peace of mind.

He is spreading it among people who are being saved and people who are dying. <verse eid="2CO 2:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2CO 2:16"/>To those who are dying, we are the smell of death. To those who are being saved, we are the perfume of life. Who is able to do this work? <verse eid="2CO 2:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 2:17"/>Unlike many people, we aren’t selling God’s word to make money. In fact, it is just the opposite.

Everyone knows you and reads you. <verse eid="2CO 3:2"/><verse number="3" style="v" sid="2CO 3:3"/>You make it clear that you are a letter from Christ. You are the result of our work for God.

The power to do what we do comes from God. <verse eid="2CO 3:5"/><verse number="6" style="v" sid="2CO 3:6"/>He has given us the power to serve under a new covenant. The covenant is not based on the written Law of Moses. It comes from the Holy Spirit. The written Law kills, but the Spirit gives life.<verse eid="2CO 3:6"/></para>

  <para style="p">
    <verse number="7" style="v" sid="2CO 3:7"/>The Law was written in letters on stone. Even though it was a way of serving God, it led to death. But even that way of serving God came with glory. The glory lasted for only a short time. Even so, the people of Israel couldn’t look at Moses’ face very long. <verse eid="2CO 3:7"/><verse number="8" style="v" sid="2CO 3:8"/>Since all this is true, won’t the work of the Holy Spirit be even more glorious? <verse eid="2CO 3:8"/><verse number="9" style="v" sid="2CO 3:9"/>The law that condemns people to death had glory. How much more glory does the work of the Spirit have! His work makes people right with God. <verse eid="2CO 3:9"/><verse number="10" style="v" sid="2CO 3:10"/>The glory of the old covenant is nothing compared with the far greater glory of the new. <verse eid="2CO 3:10"/><verse number="11" style="v" sid="2CO 3:11"/>The glory of the old lasts for only a short time. How much greater is the glory of the new! It will last forever.<verse eid="2CO 3:11"/></para>

He used to cover his face with a veil. That was to keep the people of Israel from seeing the end of what was passing away. <verse eid="2CO 3:13"/><verse number="14" style="v" sid="2CO 3:14"/>But their minds were made stubborn. To this day, the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. The veil has not been removed. Only faith in Christ can take it away. <verse eid="2CO 3:14"/><verse number="15" style="v" sid="2CO 3:15"/>To this day, when the Law of Moses is read, a veil covers the minds of those who hear it. <verse eid="2CO 3:15"/><verse number="16" style="v" sid="2CO 3:16"/>But when anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. <verse eid="2CO 3:16"/><verse number="17" style="v" sid="2CO 3:17"/>Now the Lord is the Holy Spirit. And where the Spirit of the Lord is, freedom is also there. <verse eid="2CO 3:17"/><verse number="18" style="v" sid="2CO 3:18"/>None of our faces are covered with a veil. All of us can see the Lord’s glory and think deeply about it. So we are being changed to become more like him so that we have more and more glory. And this glory comes from the Lord, who is the Holy Spirit.<verse eid="2CO 3:18"/></para>
