  <para style="imt">Introduction</para>
  <para style="im">The Gospel of Mark was written by John Mark. He worked very closely with Peter, one of Jesus’ disciples. Mark tells the story of Jesus for people living in Rome. Near the end of the story Mark tells about a Roman soldier. This soldier says that Jesus is the Son of God.</para>
  <para style="ip">The Gospel of Mark moves quickly from one event to the next. The first half deals with the key question: Who do people say Jesus is? An event at the end of this section shows Jesus healing a blind man. The blind man slowly comes to see. In the same way the disciples slowly come to understand who Jesus is. Finally Peter states clearly that Jesus is the Messiah.</para>
  <para style="ip">In the second half of the book there is a struggle between the religious leaders and Jesus. Jesus has come to introduce a very different way of life. That way of life will change things. It will change the existing power relationships among the leaders and the people. This second half of the story is presented in three parts.</para>
  <para style="ip">First, Jesus and his disciples travel to Jerusalem. Jesus enters Jerusalem being called a king.</para>
  <para style="ip">Second, Jesus teaches in the temple. There he challenges the leaders of the temple.</para>
  <para style="ip">Third, those leaders put into action their plan against Jesus. They have Jesus arrested and crucify him. They believe they have undone the work of Jesus. But God overturns their evil deed and raises Jesus from the dead.</para>
  <para style="ip">Those who read the book of Mark are called to be faithful to Jesus, even when they suffer. Jesus had to suffer in order for God’s saving plan to be completed. It is through suffering that God’s plan of new life is established.</para>
