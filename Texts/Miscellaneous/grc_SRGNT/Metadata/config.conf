#!
#! Common configuration
#! ====================
#!
#! Each text needs a Metadata/config.conf file, to which end, you should copy
#! this present file and then change it as necessary.
#!
#! There are an awful lot of configuration parameters which you may usefully
#! want to change (usefully in the sense that changing them may actually do
#! something), but for most texts there will be relatively few which you _need_
#! to change, and probably all of them are referred to here.
#!
#! In general, the items here split into two categories -- those for which I
#! have already supplied values, and those which I have recorded as requiring
#! a value.
#!
#! Where I have supplied values, very often it is to force things to be 'safe'
#! by default -- for example, to force validation.  You may actually require a
#! more laid back attitude with some texts, which you can achieve by altering
#! these values, but at least by setting 'safe' values here, you are forced to
#! make that call consciously.
#!
#! Where I have _not_ supplied values, in general it is because it is not
#! possible to come up with a default setting -- for example with things
#! like the website address for the owning organisation.  Here in general I give
#! the associated value as @Mandatory or @MandatoryMayBeEmpty.  In both cases
#! you must overtly include a definition for the item, but in the latter case,
#! you can give value as empty (ie can omit anything to the right of teh equals
#! sign) if no specific value is available.
#!
#! Note that definitions are included here to permit you to pick up information
#! from external metadata files (such as those supplied by DBL), and if you do
#! that, the definitions you give here may be overridden by settings associated
#! with these external sources
#!
#! As a particular example, you can specify here whether a particular module
#! should be encrypted, but if you indicate that the text has been supplied
#! by Biblica, the setting will be forced to Yes irrespective of what appears
#! in this present file.  Similarly there are some definitions which may be
#! satisfied from the metadata.xml files supplied with texts from DBL.
#!
#! In summary, therefore, having copied the present file to the Metadata folder
#! for your text, your task is to change your copy of the file as follows:
#!
#! - Set stepFileSelectorForOwnerOrganisation to 'Biblica' on texts supplied by
#!   Biblica.
#!
#! - Set stepFileSelectorForExternalDataFormat to 'Dbl' on texts obtained from
#!   DBL (assuming you want to pick up settings from the DBL metadata).
#!
#! - Check all of the other settings in the present file, and alter or fill
#!   them in as necessary.
#!
#! - Add any other definitions you may require (either directly within your
#!   copy of the present file, or via $include's of your own files).  The
#!   rationale for doing this is somewhat limited, though.  You might do it
#!   in order to override some of the default definitions in the various
#!   configuration files which are stored in the JAR's Resources section;
#!   or you might do it, for example, in order to set up your own
#!   vernacular translations for standard footnote texts (discussed in
#!   more detail below).  Apart from that, there is probably little reason
#!   for you to add your own definitions.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! Terminology
#! ===========
#!
#! TextOwnerOrganisation refers to the organisation which owns the copyright
#! or has other rights over the text.
#!
#! TextRepository organisation refers to the organisation which runs the
#! repository from which the text was obtained.
#!
#! The two may or may not be the same.  For example, Biblica texts are typically
#! held in the DBL database, so the text owner is Biblica, and the text
#! repository is DBL.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! Use of markup
#! =============
#!
#! Some of the information here ends up being displayed eg on copyright pages in
#! STEP.  In most (all?) cases, the values associated with these items can be
#! given in the form of HTML markup.
#!
#! Strictly, in fact, we should not be using HTML -- we should limit ourselves
#! to the markup defined by Crosswire, because there is no guarantee in general
#! that if we supply a module to a third party, it will be displayed in a
#! browser.  However, HTML works for us, and since we're already being pushed
#! into non-compliance in other areas, this probably doesn't really make things
#! much worse.
#!
#!
#!
#!
#!
#! Vernacular translations
#! =======================
#!
#! One particular reason for wanting to add extra definitions beyond the ones
#! which appear in this file is to provide vernacular translations of the
#! various standard footnote texts which the system uses, or to add your own
#! definitions detailing how scripture references are formatted in the text you
#! are processing.
#!
#! The easiest way to do this is to take your own copy of
#! Resources/ReferenceFormats/referenceFormatVernacularDefaults.conf and / or
#! Resources/TextTranslations/vernacularTextTranslations.conf (or of those
#! definitions within these files which you need to override), and then
#! define things appropriately.
#!
#! You can include these definitions either directly within your copy of
#! config.conf, or within other include files of your own.  (The latter
#! approach has the advantage that if you co-locate the root folders of all
#! texts which have shared requirements in this respect, you can share just
#! one copy of the include files.)
#!
#! If you _do_ opt to use separate include files, I recommend calling them
#! vernacularTextTranslations_xxx.conf or referenceFormats_xxx.conf, where
#! xxx is the 3-character ISO code for the language.

#!
#! If you understand what you're doing, you can insert anything you want here,
#! bearing in mind that in general later definitions override earlier ones, and
#! therefore any definitions introduced via the $include'd files mentioned below
#! will override your definitions.
#!
#! Most likely, you may want to include definitions of the form:
#!
#!   someName#=someValue (note the hash sign)
#!
#! where the #= lets you give definitions which will _not_ be overridden by
#! later ones.
#!
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

#! INSERT ANY DEFINITIONS HERE.


#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#!
#! You need supply stepFileSelectorForOwnerOrganisation and / or
#! stepFileSelectorForExternalDataFormat only if you are working with texts for
#! which there is standard information available (which, at the time of writing,
#! means a) anything from the DBL library, and b) anything supplied to us by
#! Biblica. Both should use sentence case.
#!
#! stepFileSelectorForOwnerOrganisation lets the system pick up standard
#! information for the owner organisation where available (and at present,
#! it's only available for Biblica).  Otherwise you'd have to define anything
#! necessary yourself.  It majors on things like copyright conditions,
#! licensing terms, etc.
#!
#! stepFileSelectorForExternalDataFormat lets you pick up standard definitions
#! relating to a given data repository.  Usually the main or only purpose of
#! this is to make use of functionality built into the system which extracts
#! configuration information automatically from configuration files supplied by
#! that organisation.  For example, this makes it possible to pick up
#! information directly from the metadata.xml files supplied by Biblica, rather
#! than having to transcribe it manually.
#!
#1 Make sure you use '#=', and not just '=', for these two definitions.
#!
#! Use '#=' here to prevent anything else from overriding these definitions.
#!
#! If you use these definitions, they must come before the $include for
#! $common/commonForTargetSword.conf
#!

#!
#! Final validation normally checks verse ordering and reports as an error places
#! where things are out of order.  However, some texts (at the time of writing,
#! notably deu_HFA) have things which are out of order in the first place.  The
#! setting below tells the processing whether to report errors or warnings
#! when things are out of order (assuming that validation is being applied --
#! this is controlled not by a configuration parameter, but by a compile-time
#! flag).

stepValidationReportOutOfOrderAsError=Yes

#!
#! Sometimes we may want to make fairly significant changes to a text
#! (particularly in support of reversification).  My assumption is that we may
#! not always want to do this, because it may violate copyright conditions.
#!
#! Admittedly, this may be a fairly blunt instrument -- for example, some
#! publishers may be happy for us to add footnotes but not to alter the text,
#! while others may not accept any changes at all, and I do not go down to that
#! level of granularity.
#!
#! Options here are:
#!
#! - Y(es), T(rue): You can make any changes you like.
#!
#! - N(o), F(alse): You can't make any significant changes.  (The default.)
#! 
#! - AsLicence: You can make changes unless stepAbout contains the copyright or
#!   trademark symbol, or the words 'Copyright' or 'Trademark'.
#!
#! All options are case-insensitive, and the processing is interested only in the
#! first character of each.

#! Type of reversification required.  You _can_ set this from the command line

#! on that, you won't be able to use the automated processing to run over all
#! texts and rebuild them (because the automated processing does not let you
#! stipulate command-line parameters for each text for the converter).
#!
#! Any command-line setting takes priority.

stepReversificationType=None

#! ConverterOsisToSwordController, because there is a following para which adds

#!
#! These two between them give the major and minor revision numbers for the text
#! itself.  Very often these will come from the translating organisation.  This
#! is slightly complicated ...
#!
#! * In recent translations, this is likely to come from the owning
#!   organisation.  If you don't have anything available, you'll need to make up
#!   a value, for the major revision at least.  1.0 is probably as good as
#!   anything.
#!
#! * Sword mandates (or at any rate strongly recommends) a major revision like
#!   9.8.  The minor revision is optional, but if supplied should be an
#!   integer.  What should be done to satisfy Crosswire's requirements if the
#!   translating organisation doesn't use revision indicators of this form (or
#!   doesn't make them available), I don't know.
#!
#! * There seems to be no provision for a version number of our own -- for
#!   example, if we have to reissue the same text more than once because of
#!   earlier errors in the conversion process.
#!
#! * If you have a revision number which already includes the minor revision
#!   (and is of the form 1.2.3), give the full revision number as the major
#!   number, and leave the minor number as '{empty}'.

stepAboutAsSupplied=The 2022 Statistical Restoration is the first computer-generated text derived directly from the earliest manuscript witnesses using an algorithmic statistical model to simulate a reasoned-eclecticism approach, weighing both external and internal evidence in an objective manner. The external evidence is based on statistical reliability, earliness, and diversity of support, and the internal evidence is based on word probabilities within a variant unit and consideration of variant patterns. This process provides a consistently-weighed text without human bias that is both scientifically inspectable and reproducible, and yet still has close agreement to our best modern critical texts.\

#!
#! Module naming is far more complicated than I would like.  To a first
#! approximation, it is based upon the name of the root folder for the text,
#! which is of the form eg en_KJV, where the part before the underscore is a 2-
#! or 3- character language code, and the rest is an abbreviation for the text.
#! However, we then said that partly to reflect our own involvement, and partly
#! to avoid ambiguous module names, we'd add an underscore on the end of names
#! where STEP had added value (or rather, where it had made significant
#! changes).  At one stage this was to have been _sb ('sb' for STEP Bible), but
#! we then decided this might make it appear we were claiming too much for our
#! own efforts in comparison with those of the translators, and so we dropped
#! back to using just an underscore.
#!
#! However, on 13-Apr-22, DIB has suggested that because of the shortage of
#! screen real-estate on phones etc, even this modest decoration will often be
#! too much.  So although we need to retain the option to add the underscore, it
#! now appears that we need to be able to control whether this actually happens
#! or not -- hence the setting below.  (The idea is that we will use it only
#! where things would be ambiguous without.)

#!
#! A little difficult to explain ...
#!
#! First off, this is not actually relevant to the processing at all, beyond
#! the fact that it will store it somewhere or other.  I am including it purely
#! to give us a unique id which might be of use to any admin tool we develop.
#!
#! So, what we are trying to achieve here is a unique id.  Often a publisher
#! (or a repository such as DBL) give the texts their own unique id, and you
#! can store this against stepTextIdSuppliedBySourceRepositoryOrOwnerOrganisation.
#!
#! However, although this id may be unique across the texts managed by that
#! organisation, there is no guarantee it will be globally unique -- another
#! organisation may use the same id.
#!
#! To attempt to ensure global uniqueness, you can specify any string you like
#! for stepDisambiguatorForId (you might perhaps choose 'DBL' for a DBL text
#! for instance).  The two values are then used jointly as the id.
#!
#! Because these are not actually used by the processing, you are at liberty
#! to make the assumption that in fact we shan't get round to implementing any
#! admin tool which relies upon them, and therefore given them both as
#! '{empty}'.
