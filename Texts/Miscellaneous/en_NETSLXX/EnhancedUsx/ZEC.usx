<verse sid="ZEC 1:1"/>In the eighth month of the second year of Darius, a word of the Lord came to the prophet Zacharias the son of Barachias son of Addo, saying:<verse eid="ZEC 1:1"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:2"/>The Lord was angry with great anger with your fathers.<verse eid="ZEC 1:2"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:3"/>And you will say to them, This is what the Lord Almighty says: Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord.<verse eid="ZEC 1:3"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:4"/>And do not be like your fathers, against whom the former prophets brought a charge, saying, "This is what the Lord Almighty says, Turn away from your evil ways and from your evil practices." And they gave no heed to listen to me, says the Lord.<verse eid="ZEC 1:4"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:5"/>Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, will they live forever?<verse eid="ZEC 1:5"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:6"/>But receive my words and my precepts, which I command my slaves the prophets through my spirit; did they not overtake your fathers? And they answered and said, "As the Lord Almighty arranged to do according to our ways and according to our practices, so he did to us."<verse eid="ZEC 1:6"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:7"/>On the twenty-fourth of the eleventh month-- this is the month Sabat-- in the second year of Darius, a word of the Lord came to the prophet Zacharias the son of Barachias son of Addo, saying,<verse eid="ZEC 1:7"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:8"/>In the night I have seen, and behold, a man riding on a red horse! And this one stood among the shaded mountains, and behind him were red and gray and spotted and white horses.<verse eid="ZEC 1:8"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:9"/>And I said, "What are these things, lord?" And the angel who talked with me said to me, "I will show you what these are."<verse eid="ZEC 1:9"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:10"/>And the man who stood among the mountains answered and said to me, "These are those whom the Lord has sent to patrol the earth."<verse eid="ZEC 1:10"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:11"/>And they answered the angel of the Lord who stood among the mountains and said, "We have patrolled all the earth, and lo, the whole earth is settled and at rest."<verse eid="ZEC 1:11"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:12"/>And the angel of the Lord answered and said, "O Lord Almighty, how long will you show no mercy toward Ierou-salem and the cities of Ioudas, which you have neglected this seventieth year?"<verse eid="ZEC 1:12"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:13"/>And the Lord Almighty replied to the angel who talked with me with good words and comforting tidings.<verse eid="ZEC 1:13"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:14"/>And the angel who talked with me said to me, Cry out, saying: This is what the Lord Almighty says: I have been jealous with great jealousy for Ierousalem and for Sion.<verse eid="ZEC 1:14"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:15"/>And I am angry with great anger against the nations who joined together in an attack. Because I was angry in regard to a few things, but they joined together in attacking for evil.<verse eid="ZEC 1:15"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:16"/>Therefore, this is what the Lord says, I will return to Ierousalem with compassion, and my house shall be rebuilt in it, says the Lord Almighty, and a measure shall again be stretched out over Ierousalem.<verse eid="ZEC 1:16"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:17"/>And the angel who talked with me said to me, Cry out saying: This is what the Lord Almighty says: Cities shall again be flooded with good things, and the Lord will again show mercy to Sion and again choose Ierousalem.<verse eid="ZEC 1:17"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:18"/>And I lifted up my eyes and saw and behold four horns.<verse eid="ZEC 1:18"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:19"/>And I said to the angel who talked with me, "What are these, lord?" And he said to me, "These are the horns that have scattered Ioudas and Israel."<verse eid="ZEC 1:19"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:20"/>And the Lord showed me four craftsmen.<verse eid="ZEC 1:20"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 1:21"/>And I said, "What are these coming to do?" And he said to me, "These are the horns that scattered Ioudas, and they broke Israel in pieces, and none of them raised a head. And these came to sharpen them, the four horns into their hands, even the nations who raised their horns against the land of the Lord to scatter it."<verse eid="ZEC 1:21"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:1"/>And I raised my eyes and saw, and behold, a man and a measuring line in his hand.<verse eid="ZEC 2:1"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:2"/>And I said to him, "Where are you going?" And he said to me, "To measure Ierousalem, to see how great is its width and how great is its length."<verse eid="ZEC 2:2"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:3"/>And behold, the angel who talked with me stood still, and another angel came forward to meet him<verse eid="ZEC 2:3"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:4"/>and said to him, saying, "Run, and speak to that young man, saying, Ierousalem shall be abundantly settled, because of a multitude of people and animals in it.<verse eid="ZEC 2:4"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:5"/>And I will be to it, says the Lord, a wall of fire round about, and I will become glory in its midst."<verse eid="ZEC 2:5"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:7"/>Return safe to Sion, you who inhabit daughter Babylon.<verse eid="ZEC 2:7"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:8"/>For this is what the Lord Almighty says: Behind glory he has sent me to the nations who despoiled you. For he who touches you is as one who touches the pupil of his eye.<verse eid="ZEC 2:8"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:9"/>For behold, I am bringing my hand against them, and they shall be booty to their own slaves. And you will know that the Lord Almighty has sent me.<verse eid="ZEC 2:9"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:10"/>Rejoice, and be glad, O daughter Sion. For behold, I am coming and will tent in your midst, says the Lord.<verse eid="ZEC 2:10"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:11"/>And many nations shall flee to the Lord for refuge on that day and shall become a people to him, and they will tent in your midst. And you shall recognize that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you.<verse eid="ZEC 2:11"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:12"/>And the Lord will inherit Ioudas, his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Ierousalem.<verse eid="ZEC 2:12"/>

<verse sid="ZEC 2:13"/>Let all flesh be cautious before the Lord, for he has roused himself from his holy clouds.<verse eid="ZEC 2:13"/>
