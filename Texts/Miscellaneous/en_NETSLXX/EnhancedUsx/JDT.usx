<verse sid="JDT 1:1"/>It was the twelfth year of the reign of Nabouchodonosor, who ruled over the Assyrians from Nineue, the great city. It was in the days of Arphaxad, who ruled over the Medes from Ecbatana<verse eid="JDT 1:1"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:2"/>and who had built walls around Ecbatana from stones hewn to a breadth of three cubits<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">In the measurement of stone, the cubit was equivalent to about one and a half feet</char></note> and to a length of six cubits and made the height of the wall seventy cubits and its breadth fifty cubits<verse eid="JDT 1:2"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:3"/>and raised up its towers at its gates<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:3</char><char closed="false" style="ft">bI.e. 'the city-gates'</char></note> one hundred cubits and laid out their foundations to a breadth of sixty cubits<verse eid="JDT 1:3"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:4"/>and made its gates, gates rising to a height of seventy cubits and their width being forty cubits for the passage of his army<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = 'armies'</char></note> of chief men and the ranks of his foot-soldiers.<verse eid="JDT 1:4"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:5"/>And it was in those days that King Nabouchodonosor made war against King Arphaxad in the Great Plain, that is, the plain on the frontier of Rhagau.<verse eid="JDT 1:5"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:6"/>And there rallied against<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'to'</char></note> him all the inhabitants of the highlands and all who dwelt by the Euphrates and the Tigris and the Hydaspes and in the plain of Arioch, king of the Elymeans. And a great many nations gathered for the battle of the sons of Cheleoud<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'of the sons of Cheleoud gathered for battle'</char></note>.<verse eid="JDT 1:6"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:7"/>And Nabouchodonosor, king of the Assyrians, had sent to all those who inhabit Persia and to all the inhabitants of the west, the inhabitants of Cilicia and Damascus and Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon and all the inhabitants facing the coast<verse eid="JDT 1:7"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:8"/>and those among the nations of Carmel and Galaad and Upper Galilee and the great plain of Esdrelom<verse eid="JDT 1:8"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:9"/>and all those in Samaria and its cities and beyond the Jordan as far as Ierousalem and Batane and Chelous and Kades and the wadi<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:9</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = 'river'</char></note> of Egypt and Taphnas and Ramesse and all the land of Gesem;<verse eid="JDT 1:9"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:10"/>until one comes above Tanis and Memphis, and all the inhabitants of Egypt, until one comes to the frontier of Ethiopia.<verse eid="JDT 1:10"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:11"/>And all the inhabitants throughout all<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = Omit</char></note> the land had contempt for the word of Nabouchodonosor, king of the Assyrians, and did not join with him for the war, for they did not fear him; rather, in their eyes he was but one man, and they sent back his messengers empty-handed and shamefaced.<verse eid="JDT 1:11"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:12"/>And Nabouchodonosor became violently angry at all this land and swore by his throne and by his kingdom that he would punish the entire region of Cilicia and the Damascene and Syria and that he would dispatch with his sword all the inhabitants of the land of Moab and the sons of Ammon and all Judea and all those in Egypt, until one comes to the region of the two seas.<verse eid="JDT 1:12"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:13"/>And in the seventeenth year, he took the field of battle before his army against King Arphaxad and prevailed in his war. And he turned back the entire army of Arphaxad, all his cavalry and all his chariots;<verse eid="JDT 1:13"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:14"/>and he seized his cities. And he came as far as Ecbatana and gained possession of the towers and looted its streets, and its honor he turned to its shame.<verse eid="JDT 1:14"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:15"/>And he overtook Arphaxad in the mountains of Rhagau and struck him down with his spears and destroyed him unto that day<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:15</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'unto that day':  I.e. 'to this day'</char></note>.<verse eid="JDT 1:15"/>

<verse sid="JDT 1:16"/>And he returned with them, he and all his mongrel force, an enormously large body of warriors, and he spent one hundred and twenty days there, he and his army, in idleness and merriment.<verse eid="JDT 1:16"/>

'March/April'</char></note>, there was word in the household of Nabouchodonosor, king of the Assyrians, that he would punish all the land, just as he had said.<verse eid="JDT 2:1"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:2"/>And he summoned together all his attendants and all his nobles and put before them the secret of his purpose. And from his mouth he recounted every vice<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'recounted every vice':  Perhaps 'recounted all the vice', i.e. 'concluded the affliction'</char></note> of the land;<verse eid="JDT 2:2"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:3"/>and they decided to destroy all flesh, all who did not heed the word from his mouth.<verse eid="JDT 2:3"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:4"/>And it came to pass, when he had completed his counsel, Nabouchodonosor, king of the Assyrians, called for Olophernes, the field marshal of his army, being second in command after him, and said to him:<verse eid="JDT 2:4"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:5"/>"This is what the Great King, Lord of all the earth, says: Behold, you shall go forth from my presence, and you shall take with you men who rely on their strength, as many as one hundred and twenty thousand infantry and a troop of horse with twelve thousand riders.<verse eid="JDT 2:5"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:6"/>And you shall go forth to meet all the land to the west, for they disobeyed the word of my mouth,<verse eid="JDT 2:6"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:7"/>and you shall instruct them to make ready earth and water<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'earth and water':  I.e. 'tokens of submission'</char></note>, for in my fury I will come upon them and cover all the face of the land with the feet of my army and hand them over for their plunder.<verse eid="JDT 2:7"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:8"/>And their slain shall fill their ravines, and every wadi and river overflowing<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:8</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = 'wadis, and the river overflowing'</char></note> shall be filled with their dead.<verse eid="JDT 2:8"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:9"/>And I will lead them captive to the ends of all the earth.<verse eid="JDT 2:9"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:10"/>Now when you go forth, you shall occupy in advance all their territory for me, and they shall surrender themselves to you, and you shall watch them closely for me until the day of their censure.<verse eid="JDT 2:10"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:11"/>As for those who refuse to comply, your eye shall not spare to hand them over for slaughter and plunder in each of your lands.<verse eid="JDT 2:11"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:12"/>For as I live, and on the might of my kingdom, I have spoken, and I will accomplish these things by my hand.<verse eid="JDT 2:12"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:13"/>You too shall not transgress even one of the words of your lord; rather, when you carry them out, you are to carry them out just as I have ordered you and not put off their doing."<verse eid="JDT 2:13"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:14"/>And Olophernes set out from the presence of his lord and summoned all the lords and the generals and commanders of the army of Assour,<verse eid="JDT 2:14"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:15"/>and he numbered chosen men for battle, just as his lord had commanded him, as many as one hundred and twenty thousand and twelve thousand mounted archers,<verse eid="JDT 2:15"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:16"/>and he formed them up in the way troops are drawn up for war.<verse eid="JDT 2:16"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:17"/>And he took for their baggage camels and donkeys and mules, a vastly large number, and for their provision sheep and cattle and goats, which were countless,<verse eid="JDT 2:17"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:18"/>and for every man a store of provisions aplenty and ever so much gold and silver from the king's household.<verse eid="JDT 2:18"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:19"/>And he set out on the march, he and all his army, to go before King Nabouchodonosor and cover all the face of the land to the west with their chariots and knights and picked infantry.<verse eid="JDT 2:19"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:20"/>Great also was the mongrel troop, which grasshopper-like accompanied them; indeed, they were as the sand of the ground, for they were countless owing to their sheer multitude.<verse eid="JDT 2:20"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:21"/>And from Nineue they made a three-day march toward the face of the plain of Bektileth and encamped down from Bektileth near the mountain, which is toward the left<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:21</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. Hebrew = 'north'</char></note> of upper Cilicia.<verse eid="JDT 2:21"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:22"/>And he took all his army, infantry and cavalry, and his chariots and departed from there into the highlands.<verse eid="JDT 2:22"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:23"/>And he broke through Phoud and Loud and plundered all the sons of Rassis and the sons of Ismael, those facing the wilderness toward the south of Cheleon.<verse eid="JDT 2:23"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:24"/>And he went along the Euphrates and through Mesopotamia and razed all the high cities along the wadi Abron until one comes to the sea.<verse eid="JDT 2:24"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:25"/>And he seized the region of Cilicia and cut down all those who resisted him, and he went as far as the frontier of Iapheth, which is toward the southwest facing Arabia.<verse eid="JDT 2:25"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:26"/>And he encircled all the sons of Madiam and set alight their coverts and plundered their sheepfolds.<verse eid="JDT 2:26"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:27"/>And he went down to the plain of Damascus in the days of the wheat harvest<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:27</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'early summer'</char></note> and set all their fields ablaze, and he handed over their flocks and herds for destruction and stripped their cities and ravaged their plains, and he struck down with the sword's edge all their young men.<verse eid="JDT 2:27"/>

<verse sid="JDT 2:28"/>And upon those inhabiting the coast, those in Sidon and in Tyre and those inhabiting Sour and Okina and all those inhabiting Iemnaan, there fell a fear and dread of him, and those inhabiting Azotus and Ascalon feared him exceedingly.<verse eid="JDT 2:28"/>

<verse sid="JDT 3:1"/>And they sent envoys to him with a suit for peace, saying:<verse eid="JDT 3:1"/>

<verse sid="JDT 3:5"/>And the men arrived before Olophernes and reported to him according to these very words.<verse eid="JDT 3:5"/>

<verse sid="JDT 3:6"/>And he descended upon the coast, he and his army, and garrisoned the high cities and conscripted select men for an auxiliary.<verse eid="JDT 3:6"/>

<verse sid="JDT 3:7"/>And they and all their environs received him with garlands and dances and tambourines.<verse eid="JDT 3:7"/>

<verse sid="JDT 3:8"/>And he razed all their temples<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:8</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = 'the territory'</char></note> and cut down their sacred groves.

<verse sid="JDT 3:9"/>And he went along the face of Esdrelom near Dotaia, which is opposite the great ridge of Judea,<verse eid="JDT 3:9"/>

<verse sid="JDT 3:10"/>and he encamped between Gaibai and Scythopolis and spent a month of days there in order to assemble all the baggage of his army.<verse eid="JDT 3:10"/>

<verse sid="JDT 4:2"/>And they became most exceedingly frightened by his visage and distressed for Ierousalem and the shrine of the Lord their God,<verse eid="JDT 4:2"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:1"/>Now on the following day, Olophernes gave orders to all his army and his entire people, who were at hand for his alliance, to move off against Baityloua and to occupy in advance the ascents of the highlands and to make war on the sons of Israel.<verse eid="JDT 7:1"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:2"/>And every chief man of their number moved off that day, and their army of warriors was one hundred and seventy thousand infantry and twelve thousand cavalry, not to mention the baggage and the men who were on foot with them, a vastly large number.<verse eid="JDT 7:2"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:3"/>And they encamped at the spring in the ravine near Baityloua and stretched out to a breadth over Dothaim as far as Belbaim and to a length from Baityloua as far as Bean-field, which is opposite Esdrelom.<verse eid="JDT 7:3"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:4"/>Now when they saw their number, the sons of Israel were greatly alarmed, and each man said to the one next to him: "These ones will now lick up the face of all the land, and neither the high mountains nor the ravines nor the hills will withstand their weight."<verse eid="JDT 7:4"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:5"/>And each man, taking up their battle gear and lighting fires upon their towers, remained on guard all that night.<verse eid="JDT 7:5"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:6"/>On the second day, Olophernes led out all his horse to face the sons of Israel, who were in Baityloua,<verse eid="JDT 7:6"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:9"/>"Do but let our master hear a word, that there be no fracture within your army;<verse eid="JDT 7:9"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:10"/>for this people of the sons of Israel do not rely upon their spears but upon the heights of the mountains, wherein they themselves dwell, for it is not easy to ascend the summits of their mountains.<verse eid="JDT 7:10"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:11"/>And now, O Master, do not wage war against them as a military force is wont to do in regular battle, and not a single man of your people will fall.<verse eid="JDT 7:11"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:12"/>Remain at your camp, preserving every man of your army, and let your servants hold the spring of water, which issues forth from the foot of the mountain,<verse eid="JDT 7:12"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:13"/>for all those who inhabit Baityloua draw their water from there, and the thirst will kill them, and they will surrender their city.

<verse sid="JDT 7:14"/>And they will waste away in their famine, they and their women and their children, and before the sword comes upon them they will be laid out in the streets of their dwelling place.<verse eid="JDT 7:14"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:15"/>And you will pay them back a painful repayment, because they broke out in rebellion and did not meet your face in peace."<verse eid="JDT 7:15"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:16"/>And their words were pleasing in the eyes of Olophernes and in the eyes of all his attendants, and he instructed them to do just as they had said.<verse eid="JDT 7:16"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:17"/>And the detachment of the sons of Ammon departed, and with them five thousand of the sons of Assour, and they encamped in the valley and occupied in advance the waters and the springs of water of the sons of Israel.<verse eid="JDT 7:17"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:18"/>And the sons of Esau and sons of Ammon went up and encamped in the highlands opposite Dothaim.

And the remainder of the Assyrian army encamped in the plain and covered all the face of the land, and their tents and baggage were in a great mass, and they amounted to a vastly large number.<verse eid="JDT 7:18"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:19"/>And the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord their God, for their spirit was fainthearted, for all their enemies encircled them<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">7:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = Omit</char></note>, and there was no escape from their midst.<verse eid="JDT 7:19"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:21"/>and the cisterns were emptied out, and they were unable to drink their fill of water for a single day, for they were giving them to drink in measure.<verse eid="JDT 7:21"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:22"/>And their infants lost heart, and the women and the young men failed from thirst, and they were falling in the streets of the city and in the passages of the gates, and there was no longer strength in them.<verse eid="JDT 7:22"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:23"/>And all the people had been gathered to Ozias and the rulers of the city, the young men and the women and the children, and they cried with a loud voice and said before all the elders:<verse eid="JDT 7:23"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:26"/>And now, call upon them and surrender the whole city to the people of Olophernes and to all his army for pillage.<verse eid="JDT 7:26"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:29"/>And in the midst of their assembly, a loud wailing arose with one accord from everyone, and they cried out to the Lord God with a loud voice.<verse eid="JDT 7:29"/>

<verse sid="JDT 7:30"/>And Ozias said to them: "Take courage, brothers, let us hold out five days yet, within which our Lord God will turn his mercy towards us, for he will not forsake us completely;<verse eid="JDT 7:30"/>

<verse sid="JDT 15:9"/>Now when they came to her, they all blessed her with one accord, and they said to her: "You are the exaltation of Ierousalem; you are the great pride of Israel; you are the great boast of our race.<verse eid="JDT 15:9"/>

<verse sid="JDT 15:10"/>You accomplished all these things by your hand; you accomplished good things with Israel, and God was pleased on account of them. Be blessed before the omnipotent Lord for all time." And all the people said: "So be it."<verse eid="JDT 15:10"/>

<verse sid="JDT 15:11"/>And all the people looted the camp for thirty days, and they gave Ioudith the tent of Olophernes and all the silver service and the couches and the basins and all his furniture, and she took and placed them upon her mule, and she hitched her carts and heaped them upon them.<verse eid="JDT 15:11"/>

<verse sid="JDT 15:12"/>And every woman of Israel rushed together so as to see her, and they blessed her, and some of them performed a choral dance for her, and she took wands<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">15:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Made of olive branches wreathed with ivy</char></note> in her hands and gave them to the women who were with her.<verse eid="JDT 15:12"/>

<verse sid="JDT 15:13"/>And they crowned themselves with olive, she and those with her, and she went before all the people leading all the women in dancing, and every man of Israel, vested in armor, was following along with crowns, and they were singing hymns with their mouth.<verse eid="JDT 15:13"/>

<verse sid="JDT 15:14"/>And Ioudith began this confession in the midst of all Israel, and all the people were singing out this praise.<verse eid="JDT 15:14"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:1"/>And Ioudith said: Address my God with tambourines; sing to the<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:1</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = 'my'</char></note> Lord with cymbals. Adapt a tune and a song of praise for him; exalt and invoke his name.<verse eid="JDT 16:1"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:2"/>For the Lord is a God who crushes wars; for into his camps, in the midst of the people, he plucked me from the hand of those in pursuit of me.<verse eid="JDT 16:2"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:3"/>Assour came out of the mountains from the north; he came in the myriads of his army, of whom their multitude clogged wadis and their horse covered hills.<verse eid="JDT 16:3"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:4"/>He said he would set my territory ablaze and dispatch my young men with the sword and put my sucklings to the ground and hand my infants over for pillage and plunder my young women.<verse eid="JDT 16:4"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:5"/>The omnipotent Lord set them aside with the hand of a female.<verse eid="JDT 16:5"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:6"/>For their mighty one did not capitulate to young men, nor did sons of the Titans strike him, nor did towering Giants set upon him, but Ioudith the daughter of Merari undid him with the beauty of her face.<verse eid="JDT 16:6"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:7"/>For she stripped off the dress of her widowhood for the eminence of those who are weary<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'distressed'</char></note> in Israel. She daubed her face with an anointing,<verse eid="JDT 16:7"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:8"/>and she put up her hair in a turban, and she took a linen stole for the seduction of him.<verse eid="JDT 16:8"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:9"/>Her sandal caught his eye, and her beauty captivated his soul; the scimitar passed through his throat.<verse eid="JDT 16:9"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:10"/>The Persians shuddered at her daring, and the Medes were alarmed at her boldness.<verse eid="JDT 16:10"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:11"/>Then my lowly ones raised the war cry, and my weak ones shouted. And they were terrified; they raised their cry and turned to flight.<verse eid="JDT 16:11"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:12"/>Sons of girls pierced them through and, like children of deserters, continued to wound them. They vanished from the battle line of my Lord<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">+ Göttingen Ed. = 'God'</char></note>.<verse eid="JDT 16:12"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:13"/>I will sing to my God a new hymn: O Lord, you are great and glorious, prodigious in strength, unsurpassable.<verse eid="JDT 16:13"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:14"/>Let your entire creation be subject to you; for you spoke, and they came into being. You sent your spirit, and it built them up, and there is no one who will withstand your voice.<verse eid="JDT 16:14"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:15"/>For the mountains will be shaken from their foundations together with the waters, while the rocks will melt away like wax from your presence.

<verse sid="JDT 16:16"/>For every offering is a little thing for an odor of fragrance, and all suet is insignificant for a whole burnt offering to you, but the one fearing the Lord is great forever.<verse eid="JDT 16:16"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:17"/>Woe to the nations who plot against my race; the omnipotent Lord will punish them in the day of judgment, to send fire and worms for their flesh, and they will wail in full consciousness forever.<verse eid="JDT 16:17"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:18"/>When they came into Ierousalem, they did obeisance to God, and when the people were purified, they offered up their whole burnt offerings and their voluntary offerings and the gifts.<verse eid="JDT 16:18"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:19"/>And Ioudith dedicated all the baggage of Olophernes, all that the people had given her, and the mosquito netting, which she herself had taken from his bedroom, she gave to God as a dedication.<verse eid="JDT 16:19"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:20"/>And the people continued celebrating in Ierousalem in front of the holy precincts for three months, and Ioudith remained there with them.<verse eid="JDT 16:20"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:21"/>After these days each returned to his inheritance, and Ioudith departed for Baityloua and remained there on her property, and in her time she was renowned in all the land.<verse eid="JDT 16:21"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:23"/>And she kept increasing in stature, and she grew old in the house of her husband, one hundred and five years. And she set free her favorite slave. And she died in Baityloua, and they buried her in the cave of her husband Manasses,<verse eid="JDT 16:23"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:24"/>and the house of Israel mourned her for seven days. And before she died she divided her possessions among all the nearest of Manasses her husband and the nearest of her race.<verse eid="JDT 16:24"/>

<verse sid="JDT 16:25"/>And there was not again one who terrified the sons of Israel in the days of Ioudith and for many days after she had died.<verse eid="JDT 16:25"/>
