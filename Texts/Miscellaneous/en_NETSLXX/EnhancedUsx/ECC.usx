<verse sid="ECC 1:1"/>The words of the Ecclesiast<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:1</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. a member of an Assembly</char></note>, son of Dauid, king of Israel in Ierousalem.<verse eid="ECC 1:1"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:2"/>Vanity of vanities, said the Ecclesiast, Vanity of vanities! All things are vanity.<verse eid="ECC 1:2"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:3"/>What surplus exists for people in all their toil at which they toil under the sun?<verse eid="ECC 1:3"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:4"/>A generation goes, and a generation comes, and the earth stands forever.<verse eid="ECC 1:4"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:5"/>The sun rises, and the sun goes down and draws along to its place.<verse eid="ECC 1:5"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:6"/>When it rises there, it goes to the south and circles to the north. It circles, going in circles-- so<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note> proceeds the spirit, and on its circuits the spirit<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">', and on its circuits the spirit':  Or 'wind'</char></note> returns.<verse eid="ECC 1:6"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:7"/>All the wadis go to the sea, and the sea will not be full; to the place where the wadis go, there they turn back to go.<verse eid="ECC 1:7"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:8"/>All words are worn out<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:8</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'worn out':  Possibly 'overworked'</char></note>; a man will not be able to speak; the eye will not be satisfied with seeing, and the ear will not be filled with hearing.<verse eid="ECC 1:8"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:9"/>What is that which has happened? It is that which will happen! And what is that which has been done? It is that which will be done. And there is nothing novel under the sun.<verse eid="ECC 1:9"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:10"/>As for the person who will speak and say, "See, this is new!"-- it has already happened in the ages that have been before us.<verse eid="ECC 1:10"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:11"/>There is no remembrance of earlier people, indeed, of those born later-- there will not be a remembrance of them with those who will be born at the last.<verse eid="ECC 1:11"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:12"/>I, the Ecclesiast, was king over Israel in Ierousalem.<verse eid="ECC 1:12"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:13"/>And I applied my heart to seek out and to examine by wisdom concerning all things that happen under heaven, for an unhappy preoccupation<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'distraction'</char></note> God has given to human beings with which to be preoccupied.<verse eid="ECC 1:13"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:14"/>I saw all the deeds that have been done under the sun, and see, all are vanity and preference of spirit.<verse eid="ECC 1:14"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:15"/>Something crooked will not be able to be set in order, and what is lacking will not be able to be counted.<verse eid="ECC 1:15"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:16"/>I spoke in my heart by saying, "As for me, see, I have become great and have added wisdom to all who were before me in Ierousalem, and my heart saw many things regarding wisdom and knowledge."<verse eid="ECC 1:16"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:17"/>And I applied my heart to know wisdom and knowledge; derangements and understanding I understood, that, indeed, this is preference of spirit.<verse eid="ECC 1:17"/>

<verse sid="ECC 1:18"/>For in a great quantity of wisdom is a great quantity of knowledge, and those who increase knowledge will increase suffering.<verse eid="ECC 1:18"/>

<_X_chapter sid="ECC 2">
<verse sid="ECC 2:1"/>I said in my heart, "Come now; let me test you with enjoyment; see in good!" And see, indeed, this was vanity.<verse eid="ECC 2:1"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:2"/>Of laughter I said, "Madness," and of enjoyment, "Why are you doing this?"<verse eid="ECC 2:2"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:3"/>I looked about in my heart whether to draw my flesh into wine-- and my heart guided in wisdom-- and whether to lay hold on folly until I might see what kind of thing is good for human beings to do under the sun, the number of the days of their life.<verse eid="ECC 2:3"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:4"/>I made my work great; I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself.<verse eid="ECC 2:4"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:5"/>I made myself gardens and parks, and I planted in them every fruit tree.<verse eid="ECC 2:5"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:6"/>I made myself pools of water to water from them a grove sprouting trees.<verse eid="ECC 2:6"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:7"/>I acquired male and female slaves, and I had homebred; indeed, I had great possessions of herds and flocks, more than all who had been before me in Ierousalem.<verse eid="ECC 2:7"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:8"/>I gathered for myself, indeed, silver and gold and valued possessions of kings and of the territories; I got male singers and female singers and the delights of human beings, a cupbearer and pitchers<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:8</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'female cupbearers'</char></note>.<verse eid="ECC 2:8"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:9"/>And I became great and increased more than all who were before me in Ierousalem; indeed, my wisdom stood firm for me.<verse eid="ECC 2:9"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:10"/>Anything for which my eyes begged, I did not take away from them; I did not hinder my heart from any enjoyment, because my heart rejoiced in all my toil and this was my portion from all my toil.<verse eid="ECC 2:10"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:11"/>And I looked at all my works that my hands had done and at the toil wherein I toiled to do it<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note> and see, all were vanity and preference of spirit, and there is no surplus under the sun.<verse eid="ECC 2:11"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:12"/>And I looked to see wisdom and madness and folly, for who is the person who will come to follow the plan<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'counsel'</char></note> in as many things as he made it.<verse eid="ECC 2:12"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:13"/>And I saw that wisdom excels folly as light excels darkness.<verse eid="ECC 2:13"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:14"/>As for the wise, their eyes are in their head, and the fool goes in darkness, And I know, indeed I, that one eventuality will befall them all.<verse eid="ECC 2:14"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:15"/>And I said in my heart, "As it befalls the fool, indeed, it will befall me, and why have I become wise?" I then spoke excessively in my heart, because a fool will speak from excess, that, indeed, this is vanity.<verse eid="ECC 2:15"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:16"/>For there is no remembrance ever of the wise with the fool, inasmuch as already the coming days, even all things, are forgotten, and how will the wise die with the fool?<verse eid="ECC 2:16"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:17"/>And I hated life, because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me, for all things are vanity and preference of spirit.<verse eid="ECC 2:17"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:18"/>I hated all my toil in which I am toiling under the sun, because I am leaving it to the person being born after me<verse eid="ECC 2:18"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:19"/>-- and who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? And he will have authority over all my toil at which I toiled and became wise under the sun; indeed, this is vanity.<verse eid="ECC 2:19"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:20"/>And I turned to bid farewell with my heart to all the toil at which I toiled under the sun.<verse eid="ECC 2:20"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:21"/>For there is a person whose toil is with wisdom and knowledge and manliness, and a person who did not toil at it: he will give him his portion; indeed, this is vanity and a great evil.<verse eid="ECC 2:21"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:22"/>For what happens<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:22</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'belongs'</char></note> to mortals in all their toil and in the preference of their heart with which they toil under the sun?<verse eid="ECC 2:22"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:23"/>For all their days are days<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:23</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note> of pains, and their preoccupation is of anger; indeed, at night their heart does not sleep. Indeed, this is vanity.<verse eid="ECC 2:23"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:24"/>It is not good in humans<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:24</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'It is not good in humans':  Perhaps 'There is nothing better in humans than'</char></note> what they will eat and what they will drink and what they will show to their soul as good in their toil. Indeed, this, I saw, is from the hand of God.<verse eid="ECC 2:24"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:25"/>For who will eat and who will refrain from eating<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:25</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note> apart from him?<verse eid="ECC 2:25"/>

<verse sid="ECC 2:26"/>For to the one who is good before him he gave wisdom and knowledge and enjoyment, and to the sinner he gave a preoccupation to add and to gather, to give to the one who is good before God, because, indeed, this is vanity and preference of spirit.<verse eid="ECC 2:26"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:1"/>For everything there is a time, and a right time for every matter under heaven:<verse eid="ECC 3:1"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:9"/>What surplus has the maker in what he toils?<verse eid="ECC 3:9"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:10"/>I saw all the preoccupation which God has given to humans to be preoccupied with.<verse eid="ECC 3:10"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:11"/>He made everything fine in its right time; indeed, he granted eternity in their heart so that they should not find the work that God has done from the beginning even to the end.<verse eid="ECC 3:11"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:12"/>I know that there is no good in them<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'no good in them':  Perhaps 'nothing better for them'</char></note> except to be glad and to do good in their life.<verse eid="ECC 3:12"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:13"/>Indeed, everyone who will eat and drink and should see good in their toil-- it is a divine gift.<verse eid="ECC 3:13"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:14"/>I know that everything that God has done-- it will be forever; to it there is nothing to add, and from it there is nothing to take away; God has done this so that all should stand in awe before him.<verse eid="ECC 3:14"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:15"/>That which happened, already is, and what is to happen, already took place, and God will seek out the one being pursued.<verse eid="ECC 3:15"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:16"/>Moreover, I saw under the sun the place of justice-- the impious was there, and the place of the righteous-- the impious was there.<verse eid="ECC 3:16"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:17"/>I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the impious, for there is a right time for every matter and for every work.<verse eid="ECC 3:17"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:18"/>There I said in my heart concerning the speech of human beings, that God will discern them, indeed, to show even to them that they are cattle.<verse eid="ECC 3:18"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:19"/>For what befalls humans and what befalls cattle-- one eventuality is for them; as the death of the one, so is the death of the other. They all have one spirit<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'breath'</char></note>, and in what way did humans excel above cattle? Nothing, because all things are vanity.<verse eid="ECC 3:19"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:20"/>All things go to one place; all things came from the dust, and all things return to the dust.<verse eid="ECC 3:20"/>

<verse sid="ECC 3:21"/>And who knows the spirit of humans, whether it ascends upward, and the spirit of cattle, whether it descends downward to the earth?<verse eid="ECC 3:21"/>

<verse sid="ECC 4:1"/>And I turned, and I saw all the extortions that take place under the sun. Look, the tear of the oppressed-- and there is no one to comfort them! From the hand of those oppressing them is strength-- and there is no one to comfort them.<verse eid="ECC 4:1"/>

<verse sid="ECC 4:2"/>And I praised the dead, who have already died, more than the living who are living until now.<verse eid="ECC 4:2"/>

<verse sid="ECC 4:3"/>And better than both is whoever has not yet been, who has not seen the grievous work that is done under the sun.<verse eid="ECC 4:3"/>

<verse sid="ECC 4:4"/>And I saw all toil and all manliness of work, that it is a man's envy of his companion. Indeed, this is vanity and preference of spirit.<verse eid="ECC 4:4"/>

<verse sid="ECC 4:5"/>Fools folded their hands and consumed their own flesh.<verse eid="ECC 4:5"/>

<verse sid="ECC 4:6"/>Better is a handful of repose than two handfuls of toil, and preference of spirit.<verse eid="ECC 4:6"/>

"For whom do I toil and deprive my life from goodness?" Even this is vanity and an unhappy preoccupation.<verse eid="ECC 4:8"/>

<verse sid="ECC 4:9"/>Better are two than one, because they have a good reward in their toil.<verse eid="ECC 4:9"/>

<verse sid="ECC 4:10"/>For if they fall, the one will raise his partner up, and woe to the one, when he falls, and there should be no second to raise him up.<verse eid="ECC 4:10"/>

<verse sid="ECC 4:11"/>Indeed, if two sleep, they also have warmth, and the one, how should he be warmed?<verse eid="ECC 4:11"/>

<verse sid="ECC 4:12"/>Even if the one should prevail, two will stand against him. A threefold cord will not be quickly broken.<verse eid="ECC 4:12"/>

<verse sid="ECC 5:2"/>(3) For a dream comes with a great amount of distraction<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">5:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'preoccupation'</char></note>, and a fool's voice with a great quantity of words.<verse eid="ECC 5:2"/>

<verse sid="ECC 5:18"/>(19) Indeed, all to whom God has given to them wealth and possessions and they have authority over them to eat from it and to take their portion and to enjoy themselves in their toil-- this is a divine gift.<verse eid="ECC 5:18"/>

<verse sid="ECC 7:23"/>All these things I tested by wisdom; I said, "I will become wise,"<verse eid="ECC 7:23"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:2"/>Keep a king's utterance, and do not be hasty about the expression of a sacred oath.<verse eid="ECC 8:2"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:5"/>Whoever keeps a command will not know anything harmful, and the heart of the wise knows the right time of decision.<verse eid="ECC 8:5"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:6"/>For to every matter there is a right time and decision, for the knowledge of mortals is great upon them.<verse eid="ECC 8:6"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:7"/>For they do not know what is going to be, for who will tell them just how it will be?<verse eid="ECC 8:7"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:8"/>There is no one having authority over the spirit to restrain the spirit, and there is no authority over the day of death; there is no discharge from the battle, and impiety will not deliver those at home with it.<verse eid="ECC 8:8"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:9"/>All this I observed, and I gave my heart to every work that is done under the sun-- things that one person exercised authority over another to hurt them.<verse eid="ECC 8:9"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:10"/>Then I saw the impious carried into tombs; they went from the holy place, and they were praised in the city that they did so. Indeed, this is vanity.<verse eid="ECC 8:10"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:11"/>Because a refutation of those doing evil there does not happen quickly-- on account of this the heart of humans was fully convinced in them to do evil.<verse eid="ECC 8:11"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:12"/>He who sinned did what was evil from then and from a length to it<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">8:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'a length to it':  Possibly 'a long time before'</char></note>; for, indeed, I know that it will be well with those who fear God so that they should fear before him,<verse eid="ECC 8:12"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:14"/>There is a vanity that is done on earth, that there are righteous people that it overtakes them according to the work of the impious, and there are ungodly that it overtakes them according as the work of the righteous.

<verse sid="ECC 8:15"/>And I praised enjoyment, for there is no good<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">8:15</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'no good':  Perhaps 'nothing better'</char></note> for people under the sun except to eat and to drink and to enjoy themselves, and this will be there with them in their toil through the days of their life that God has given to them under the sun.<verse eid="ECC 8:15"/>

<verse sid="ECC 8:17"/>then I saw all the works of God, that no one will be able to find out the work that is done under the sun; as much as one may toil to search out, he will not find; indeed, whatever the wise say they know, they will not be able to find it out.<verse eid="ECC 8:17"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:1"/>For all this I gave to my heart, and my heart saw all this: how the righteous and the wise and their deeds<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:1</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'productions'</char></note> are in the hand of God; indeed, love and, indeed, hate there is no person in the know; all things are before them;<verse eid="ECC 9:1"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:2"/>vanity is in all things. One eventuality is for the righteous and the impious, for the good and for the evil, for the clean and for the unclean, for the one who sacrifices and for the one who does not sacrifice. As are the good, so are the sinners; so are those who swear, just as those who fear an oath.<verse eid="ECC 9:2"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:3"/>This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that one eventuality is for all. Indeed, the heart of humans was filled with evil; madness is in their heart while they live, and after them they go to the dead.<verse eid="ECC 9:3"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:10"/>Whatever your hand finds to do, as is your might, do! For there is no work and reasoning<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:10</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'thought'</char></note> and knowledge and wisdom in Hades, where you are going.<verse eid="ECC 9:10"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:11"/>I turned, and I saw under the sun that the race is not to the nimble, nor the battle to the strong, nor, indeed, bread to the wise, nor, indeed, riches to the intelligent, nor, indeed, favor to those who are perceptive, because time and chance will happen to them all.<verse eid="ECC 9:11"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:12"/>For, indeed, no one knows their time. Like fish being taken with a pernicious net and like birds being caught in a snare, like them mortals are snared at a time of ruin, when it suddenly falls upon them.<verse eid="ECC 9:12"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:13"/>Indeed, this I saw as wisdom under the sun, and it was great according to me.<verse eid="ECC 9:13"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:14"/>There was a little city and few men in it, and a great king would come against it and surround it and would build a great palisaded camp<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'a great palisaded camp':  Perhaps 'great siege works'</char></note> against it,<verse eid="ECC 9:14"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:15"/>and he would find in it a poor wise man, and he himself will deliver the city by his wisdom. And no one remembered that poor man.<verse eid="ECC 9:15"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:16"/>And I said, "Better is wisdom than might, and the poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not being heard."<verse eid="ECC 9:16"/>

<verse sid="ECC 9:17"/>The words of the wise in rest are heard above the shouting of those exercising authority in follies.<verse eid="ECC 9:17"/>
