<verse sid="1KI 1:1"/>And King Dauid was old, advanced in days, and they kept clothing him with clothes, and he was not being warmed.<verse eid="1KI 1:1"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:2"/>And his servants said, "Let them search for a young virgin for our lord the king, and she shall wait on the king, and she shall be keeping him warm and shall fall asleep with him, and our lord the king shall be warmed."<verse eid="1KI 1:2"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:3"/>And they searched for a beautiful girl from every boundary of Israel and found Abisak the Somanite and brought her to the king.<verse eid="1KI 1:3"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:4"/>And the girl was beautiful, extremely so, and she was keeping the king warm and was ministering to him, but the king did not know<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

<verse sid="1KI 1:5"/>And Adonias son of Haggith was exalting himself, saying, "I will be king," and he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run along before him.<verse eid="1KI 1:5"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:6"/>And his father did not ever hinder him, saying, "For what reason did you act?" And indeed he was very youthful in appearance, and he begot<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'he begot':  Or 'she bore'</char></note> him after Abessalom.<verse eid="1KI 1:6"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:7"/>And his conferences were with Ioab the son of Sarouia and with Abiathar the priest, and they were helping behind Adonias.<verse eid="1KI 1:7"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:8"/>And Sadok the priest and Banaias son of Iodae and Nathan the prophet and Semei and Rei and the powerful men of Dauid were not behind Adonias.<verse eid="1KI 1:8"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:9"/>And Adonias offered sacrifices, sheep and calves and lambs, with stone of Zoeleth, which was next to the spring of Rogel, and he invited all his brothers and all the prominent men of Iouda, servants of the king,<verse eid="1KI 1:9"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:10"/>and Nathan the prophet and Banaias and the powerful men and Salomon his brother he did not invite.<verse eid="1KI 1:10"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:11"/>And Nathan spoke to Bersabee mother of Salomon, saying, "Did you not hear that Adonias son of Haggith became king, and our lord Dauid did not know?<verse eid="1KI 1:11"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:12"/>And now come, I will indeed give you advice. And deliver your own life and the life of your son Salomon.<verse eid="1KI 1:12"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:13"/>Come on, go in to King Dauid, and you shall speak to him, saying, 'Did you not, my lord O king, swear to your slave, saying: Salomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne? And why is it that Adonias became king?'<verse eid="1KI 1:13"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:14"/>And behold, while you are still there speaking with the king, I too will go in after you and will fill out your words."<verse eid="1KI 1:14"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:15"/>And Bersabee went in to the king into the chamber. And the king was very old, and Abisak the Somanite was ministering to the king.<verse eid="1KI 1:15"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:16"/>And Bersabee bent down and did obeisance to the king, and the king said, "What is it with you?"<verse eid="1KI 1:16"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:17"/>And she said, "My lord O king, you swore by the Lord your God to your slave, saying: Salomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne.<verse eid="1KI 1:17"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:18"/>And now, behold, Adonias became king, and you, my lord O king, did not know.<verse eid="1KI 1:18"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:19"/>And he offered sacrifices, calves and lambs and sheep in great numbers, and invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Ioab the commander of the force, but Salomon your slave he did not invite.<verse eid="1KI 1:19"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:20"/>And you, my lord O king-- the eyes of all Israel are towards you to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.<verse eid="1KI 1:20"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:21"/>And it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I myself and my son Salomon will be sinners."<verse eid="1KI 1:21"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:22"/>And behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet also came.<verse eid="1KI 1:22"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:23"/>And it was told the king, "Behold, Nathan the prophet." And he entered in front of the king and did obeisance to the king, in front of him on the ground.<verse eid="1KI 1:23"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:24"/>And Nathan said, "My lord O king, did you say, 'Adonias shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne'?<verse eid="1KI 1:24"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:25"/>For today he went down and offered sacrifices, calves and lambs and sheep in great numbers, and invited all the sons of the king and the commanders of the force and Abiathar the priest, and behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and they said, 'Let King Adonias live!'<verse eid="1KI 1:25"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:26"/>But me myself your slave and Sadok the priest and Banaias son of Iodae and Salomon your slave he did not invite.<verse eid="1KI 1:26"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:27"/>If this thing has been brought about by my lord the king, then you did not let your slave know who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him."<verse eid="1KI 1:27"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:28"/>And Dauid answered and said, "Summon to me Bersabee." And she came in before the king and stood before him.<verse eid="1KI 1:28"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:29"/>And the king swore and said, "The Lord lives, who redeemed my life from every affliction,<verse eid="1KI 1:29"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:30"/>that as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, 'Salomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne instead of me,' that so will I do this day."<verse eid="1KI 1:30"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:31"/>And Bersabee bent down on her face on the ground and did obeisance to the king and said, "Let my lord King Dauid live forever!"<verse eid="1KI 1:31"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:32"/>And King Dauid said, "Summon to me Sadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Banaias son of Iodae." And they came in before the king.<verse eid="1KI 1:32"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:33"/>And the king said to them, "Take the slaves of your lord with you and mount my son Salomon on my own mule and bring him down to Gion.<verse eid="1KI 1:33"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:34"/>And there let Sadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him king over Israel. And trumpet with a horn, and you shall say, 'Let King Salomon live!'<verse eid="1KI 1:34"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:35"/>And he shall sit on my throne, and he shall be king instead of me, and I myself commanded that he be ruler over Israel and Iouda."<verse eid="1KI 1:35"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:36"/>And Banaias son of Iodae answered the king and said, "May it be! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, so guarantee.<verse eid="1KI 1:36"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:37"/>As the Lord was with my lord the king, so may he be with Salomon, and may he make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King Dauid."<verse eid="1KI 1:37"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:38"/>And Sadok the priest went down, and Nathan the prophet and Banaias son of Iodae and Chereththi and Pheleththi, and they seated Salomon on the mule of King Dauid and led him away to Gion.<verse eid="1KI 1:38"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:39"/>And Sadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Salomon and trumpeted with the horn. And all the people said, "Let King Salomon live!"<verse eid="1KI 1:39"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:40"/>And all the people went up after him, and they were dancing in choruses and rejoicing with great joy, and the earth burst at their sound.<verse eid="1KI 1:40"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:41"/>And Adonias heard, and all his guests, and they finished eating. And Ioab heard the sound of the horn and said, "What, the sound of the city echoing?"<verse eid="1KI 1:41"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:42"/>While he was still speaking, also behold, Ionathan son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonias said, "Come in, for you are a man of power. And bring good news."<verse eid="1KI 1:42"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:43"/>And Ionathan answered and said, "Actually, our lord King Dauid made Salomon king,<verse eid="1KI 1:43"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:44"/>and the king sent with him Sadok the priest and Nathan the prophet and Banaias son of Iodae and Chereththi and Pheleththi, and they seated him on the mule of the king,<verse eid="1KI 1:44"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:45"/>and Sadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anointed him king in Gion, and they went up from there rejoicing, and the city echoed. This is the sound that you heard.<verse eid="1KI 1:45"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:46"/>And Salomon sat on the throne of the kingdom.<verse eid="1KI 1:46"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:47"/>And the slaves of the king came in to bless our lord King Dauid, saying, 'May God make the name of Salomon your son better than your name and make his throne greater than your throne.' And the king did obeisance on his bed,<verse eid="1KI 1:47"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:48"/>and indeed thus said the king, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who today gave from my offspring one sitting on my throne, and my eyes see it.' "<verse eid="1KI 1:48"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:49"/>And all the guests of Adonias were astounded and rose, and they went away, a man on his way.<verse eid="1KI 1:49"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:50"/>And Adonias was afraid from before Salomon and got up and went away and took hold of the horns of the altar.<verse eid="1KI 1:50"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:51"/>And it was told Salomon, saying, "Behold, Adonias was afraid of King Salomon, and he is holding fast to the horns of the altar, saying, 'Let King Salomon swear to me today, whether he will not put his slave to death with a sword.' "<verse eid="1KI 1:51"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:52"/>And Salomon said, "If he should become a son of power, if one of his hairs shall fall on the ground ..., but if wickedness is found in him, he shall be put to death."<verse eid="1KI 1:52"/>

<verse sid="1KI 1:53"/>And King Salomon sent and brought him down from upon the altar. And he entered and did obeisance to King Salomon, and Salomon said to him, "Come on, to your house."<verse eid="1KI 1:53"/>

<_X_chapter sid="1KI 2">
<verse sid="1KI 2:1"/>And the days of Dauid drew near for him to die, and he commanded Salomon his son, saying:<verse eid="1KI 2:1"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:2"/>"I am-- I am going by way of all the earth. And you shall be strong, and you shall become a man,<verse eid="1KI 2:2"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:3"/>and you shall keep the charge of the Lord your God, to walk in his ways, to keep his commandments and the statutes and the judgments which are written in the law of Moyses so that you may understand what you shall do in all things, whatever I command you<verse eid="1KI 2:3"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:4"/>so that the Lord may establish his word that he spoke, saying, 'If your sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with their whole heart and with their whole soul-- saying: There shall not be utterly destroyed for you a man from upon the throne of Israel.'<verse eid="1KI 2:4"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:5"/>"And indeed you knew what Ioab son of Sarouia did to me, what he did to the two commanders of the forces of Israel, to Abenner son of Ner and to Amessai son of Iether, and he killed them and arrayed the blood of war in peace and put innocent blood on his belt that was on his waist and on his sandal that was on his foot.<verse eid="1KI 2:5"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:6"/>And you shall act according to your wisdom, and you shall not bring his gray hair down in peace to Hades.<verse eid="1KI 2:6"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:7"/>And you shall do mercy to the sons of Berzelli the Galaadite, and they shall be among those who eat your table, for thus they drew near to me when I ran away from before Abessalom your brother.<verse eid="1KI 2:7"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:8"/>And behold, there is with you Semei son of Gera son of the Iemeni from Baourim, and he cursed me with a painful curse on the day when I went to Camps, and he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying, 'If I will put you to death with a sword, . . . !'<verse eid="1KI 2:8"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:9"/>And you shall not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man, and you will know what you shall do to him, and you shall bring his gray hair down with blood to Hades."<verse eid="1KI 2:9"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:10"/>And Dauid slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of Dauid.<verse eid="1KI 2:10"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:11"/>And the days that Dauid reigned over Israel were forty years; in Chebron he reigned seven years and in Ierousalem thirty-three years.<verse eid="1KI 2:11"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:12"/>And Salomon sat on the throne of his father Dauid, a son of twelve years, and his kingdom was well prepared.<verse eid="1KI 2:12"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:13"/>And Adonias son of Haggith came in to Bersabee, Salomon's mother, and did obeisance to her. But she asked, "Is your visit peace?" And he said, "Peace;<verse eid="1KI 2:13"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:14"/>a word for me with you." And she said to him, "Speak."<verse eid="1KI 2:14"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:15"/>And he said to her, "You know that the kingdom was mine and all Israel set its face on me to be king, and the kingdom was turned about and became my brother's, for it was his from the Lord.<verse eid="1KI 2:15"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:16"/>And now I request one request from you; do not turn away your face." And Bersabee said to him, "Speak on."<verse eid="1KI 2:16"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:17"/>And he said to her, "Speak now to King Salomon-- for he will not turn his face from you-- and he will give me Abisak the Somanite for a wife."<verse eid="1KI 2:17"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:18"/>And Bersabee said, "Very well; I will speak to the king on your behalf."<verse eid="1KI 2:18"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:19"/>And Bersabee went in to King Salomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonias. And the king rose to meet her and kissed her, and he sat on his throne, and a throne was placed for the king's mother, and she sat on his right.<verse eid="1KI 2:19"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:20"/>And she said to him, "I request one small request from you; do not turn your face away." And the king said to her, "Make your request, my mother, for I will not refuse you."<verse eid="1KI 2:20"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:21"/>And she said, "Let now Abisak the Somanite be given to your brother Adonias as a wife."<verse eid="1KI 2:21"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:22"/>And King Salomon answered and said to his mother, "And why do you request Abisak for Adonias? And request for him the kingdom! For he is my brother, the great one beyond me, and he has the priest Abiathar, and he has Ioab the son of Sarouia the commander-in-chief for a companion!"<verse eid="1KI 2:22"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:23"/>And King Salomon swore by the Lord, saying, "This is what God may do to me, and this may he add, for Adonias spoke this word at the risk of his life!<verse eid="1KI 2:23"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:24"/>And now the Lord lives, who prepared me and placed me on the throne of my father Dauid, and he made me a house, as the Lord spoke, for today Adonias shall be put to death."<verse eid="1KI 2:24"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:25"/>And King Salomon sent by the hand of Banaiou son of Iodae and did away with him, and Adonias died on that day.<verse eid="1KI 2:25"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:26"/>And the king said to the priest Abiathar, "Depart quickly to Anathoth, to your field, for you are a man of death on this day, and I will not put you to death, because you carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord before my father and because you were afflicted with all the hardships with which my father was afflicted."<verse eid="1KI 2:26"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:27"/>And Salomon banished Abiathar from being a priest of the Lord, to fulfill the word of the Lord that he spoke regarding the house of Eli in Selom.<verse eid="1KI 2:27"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:28"/>And the news came to Ioab the son of Sarouia-- for Ioab had inclined after Adonias and did not incline after Salomon-- and Ioab fled to the covert of the Lord and grasped the horns of the altar.<verse eid="1KI 2:28"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:29"/>And it was told to Salomon, saying, "Ioab fled to the tent of the Lord, and behold, he is grasping the horns of the altar," And Salomon sent to Ioab, saying, "What happened to you that you have fled to the altar?" And Ioab said, "Because I was afraid from before you, and I fled to the Lord." And King Salomon sent Banaiou son of Iodae, saying, "Go, and do away with him, and bury him."<verse eid="1KI 2:29"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:30"/>And Banaiou son of Iodae came to Ioab into the tent of the Lord and said to him, "This is what the king says, 'Come out.' " And Ioab said, "I am not going out, for I will die here." And Banaiou son of Iodae returned and said to the king, saying, "This is what Ioab has spoken, and this is what he has answered me."<verse eid="1KI 2:30"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:31"/>And the king said to him, "Go, and do to him as he has said, and do away with him, and you shall bury him, and today you will take away from me and from my father's house the blood that Ioab shed without cause,<verse eid="1KI 2:31"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:32"/>and the Lord brought back the blood of his injustice on his head, as he fell upon the two persons who were more righteous and better than he, and he killed them with a sword, and my father Dauid did not know of their blood, Abenner son of Ner, commander-in-chief of Israel, and Amessa son of Iether, commander-in-chief of Ioudas,<verse eid="1KI 2:32"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:33"/>and their spilled blood was brought back on his head and on the head of his offspring forever, and to Dauid and to his offspring and to his house and to his throne may there be peace from the Lord forever."<verse eid="1KI 2:33"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:34"/>And Banaiou son of Iodae came upon Ioab and put him to death and buried him at his house in the wilderness.<verse eid="1KI 2:34"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35"/>And the king put Banaiou son of Iodae in command in his place, and the kingdom was being established in Ierousalem, and the king appointed the priest Sadok first priest in the place of Abiathar. <para style="p"/><verse eid="1KI 2:35"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35a"/>(35a) (4.29) And the Lord gave Salomon discernment and very great wisdom and breadth of mind like the sand which is by the sea,<verse eid="1KI 2:35a"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35b"/>(35b) and the discernment of Salomon was greatly multiplied above the discernment of all ancient sons and above all prudent ones of Egypt.<verse eid="1KI 2:35b"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35c"/>(35c) (3.1) And he took the daughter of Pharao and brought her into the city of Dauid until he first finished his house and the house of the Lord and the wall of Ierousalem round about; in seven years he made and finished them.<verse eid="1KI 2:35c"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35d"/>(35d) And Salomon had seventy thousand bearing a burden and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hill country.<verse eid="1KI 2:35d"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35e"/>(35e) (7.23) And Salomon made the sea and the supports and the great washbasins and the pillars and the fountain of the court and the bronze sea.<verse eid="1KI 2:35e"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35f"/>(35f) And he built the citadel and its defenses, and he cut through the city of Dauid; (9.24) thus Pharao's daughter used to go up from the city of Dauid to her house which he built for her. Then he built the citadel.<verse eid="1KI 2:35f"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35g"/>(35g) (9.25) And Salomon would offer up in the year three whole burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he built for the Lord and would burn incense before the Lord. And he finished the house.<verse eid="1KI 2:35g"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35h"/>(35h) (9.23) And these are the chief officers who were appointed over the works of Salomon: (5.16) three thousand six hundred overseers of the people who did the works.<verse eid="1KI 2:35h"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35i"/>(35i) And he built Assour and Magdo and Gazer and Upper Baithoron and Baalath;<verse eid="1KI 2:35i"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35j"/>(35k) only after he built the house of the Lord and the wall of Ierousalem round about, after these he built these cities.<verse eid="1KI 2:35j"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35k"/>(35l) And while Dauid was still alive, he commanded Salomon, saying, (2.8) "Behold, with you is Semei son of Gera, son of the offspring of the Iemini, from Chebron;<verse eid="1KI 2:35k"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35l"/>(35m) he cursed me with a painful curse on the day I was going into Camps,<verse eid="1KI 2:35l"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35m"/>(35n) and he would come down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the Lord, saying: If he will be put to death with a sword . . . !<verse eid="1KI 2:35m"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:35n"/>(35o) And now do not hold him guiltless, for you are a prudent man, and you will know what you shall do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to Hades."<verse eid="1KI 2:35n"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:36"/>And the king summoned Semei and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Ierousalem, and sit there, and you shall not go out from there to any place whatever,<verse eid="1KI 2:36"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:37"/>and it will be on the day of your going out, and you shall cross the Wadi Kedron, knowing you shall know that by death you shall die; your blood shall be on your own head." And the king caused him to swear on that day.<verse eid="1KI 2:37"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:38"/>And Semei said to the king, "The dictum is fair that you have spoken, my lord O king; so will your slave do." And Semei stayed in Ierousalem three years.<verse eid="1KI 2:38"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:39"/>And it happened after three years that two of Semei's slaves ran away to King Anchous son of Maacha of Geth, and it was told Semei, saying, "Behold, your slaves are in Geth,"<verse eid="1KI 2:39"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:40"/>and Semei arose and saddled his donkey and went to Anchous in Geth to search for his slaves, and Semei went and brought his slaves from Geth.<verse eid="1KI 2:40"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:41"/>And it was reported to Salomon, saying, "Semei went from Ierousalem to Geth and brought back his slaves."<verse eid="1KI 2:41"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:42"/>And the king sent and summoned Semei and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the Lord and solemnly adjure you, saying, 'Knowing you shall know that on the day you go out of Ierousalem and go to the right or to the left, by death you shall die'?<verse eid="1KI 2:42"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:43"/>And why is it that you have not kept the oath of the Lord and the commandment which I commanded against you?"<verse eid="1KI 2:43"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:44"/>And the king said to Semei, "You know all your evil that your heart knew that you did to my father Dauid, and the Lord has recompensed your evil on your own head,<verse eid="1KI 2:44"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:45"/>and King Salomon is blessed, and the throne of Dauid shall be established before the Lord forever."<verse eid="1KI 2:45"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:46"/>And King Salomon commanded Banaia son of Iodae, and he went out and did away with him, and he died. <para style="p"/><verse eid="1KI 2:46"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:46a"/>(46a) And King Salomon was very prudent and wise, (4.20) and Ioudas and Israel were very many as the sand which is by the sea in great number, eating and drinking and being happy,<verse eid="1KI 2:46a"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:46b"/>(46b) and Salomon was chief among all the kingdoms, and they were bringing gifts, and they were subject to Salomon all the days of his life.<verse eid="1KI 2:46b"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:46c"/>(46c) And Salomon began to open the resources of Lebanon,<verse eid="1KI 2:46c"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:46d"/>(46d) and he built Thermai in the wilderness.<verse eid="1KI 2:46d"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:46e"/>(46e) And this was (4.22) the midday meal for Salomon: thirty kors<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:46</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 kor = 220 liters</char></note> of choice flour and sixty kors<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:46</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 kor = 220 liters</char></note> of ground meal, (4.23) ten choice calves and twenty pasture-fed oxen and one hundred sheep, besides deer and gazelles and choice fatted birds.<verse eid="1KI 2:46e"/>

<verse sid="1KI 2:46f"/>(46f) For he was chief everywhere across the river from Raphi to Gaza, among all the kings across the river,<verse eid="1KI 2:46f"/>

<verse sid="1KI 7:3"/>(15) And he cast the two pillars for the ailam of the house; eighteen cubits was the height of a pillar, and a circumference of fourteen cubits encompassed it, and the thickness of the pillar was the hollow of four fingers, and so the second pillar.<verse eid="1KI 7:3"/>

<verse sid="1KI 7:4"/>(16) And he made two covers of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars, five cubits the height of the one cover and five cubits the height of the second cover.<verse eid="1KI 7:4"/>

<verse sid="1KI 7:5"/>(17) And he made two lattice works to wrap around the cover of the pillars, and a lattice-work for the one cover and a lattice work for the second cover<verse eid="1KI 7:5"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:1"/>And Eliou the prophet, the Thesbite from Thesbon of Galaad, said to Achaab, "The Lord lives, the God of hosts, the God of Israel before whom I stand, if there shall be dew and rain these years, except by the word of my mouth."<verse eid="1KI 17:1"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:2"/>And a word of the Lord came to Eliou,<verse eid="1KI 17:2"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:3"/>"Go from here eastward, and hide yourself by the wadi Chorrath which is before the Jordan.<verse eid="1KI 17:3"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:4"/>And it will be that you shall drink water from the wadi, and I will command the ravens to feed you there."<verse eid="1KI 17:4"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:5"/>And Eliou did according to the word of the Lord, and he settled by the wadi Chorrath before the Jordan.<verse eid="1KI 17:5"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:6"/>And the ravens would bring him bread in the morning and meat in the evening, and he drank water from the wadi.<verse eid="1KI 17:6"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:7"/>And it happened after days that the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.<verse eid="1KI 17:7"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:8"/>And a word of the Lord came to Eliou,<verse eid="1KI 17:8"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:9"/>"Arise, and go to Sarepta of Sidonia; behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you."<verse eid="1KI 17:9"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:10"/>And he arose and went to Sarepta, to the gateway of the town, and behold a widow was there gathering sticks, and Eliou shouted after her and said, "Bring me now a little water in a vessel, and I will drink."<verse eid="1KI 17:10"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:11"/>And she went to take it, and Eliou shouted after her and said to her, "Indeed take for me a morsel of bread in your hand."<verse eid="1KI 17:11"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:12"/>And the woman said, "The Lord your God lives, if I have a cake, but there is only a handful of meal in the jar and a little oil in the jug, and behold, I am now gathering two sticks, and I shall go in and make it for myself and my children, and we shall eat and die."<verse eid="1KI 17:12"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:13"/>And Eliou said to her, "Be of good courage; go in, and do according to your word, but first make me a little cake of it, and you shall bring it to me, but afterwards you shall make something for yourself and your children.<verse eid="1KI 17:13"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:14"/>For this is what the Lord says, 'The jar of meal will not fail, and the jug of oil will not diminish until the day that the Lord gives rain on the earth.' "<verse eid="1KI 17:14"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:15"/>And the woman went and did it, and she and he and her children ate.<verse eid="1KI 17:15"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:16"/>And the jar of meal did not fail, and the jug of oil did not diminish according to the word of the Lord that he spoke by the hand of Eliou.<verse eid="1KI 17:16"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:17"/>And it happened after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill, and his illness was so severe until there was no breath left in him.<verse eid="1KI 17:17"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:18"/>And she said to Eliou, "What to me and to you, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my injustices to remembrance and to put to death my son!"<verse eid="1KI 17:18"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:19"/>And Eliou said to the woman, "Give me your son." And he took him from her bosom and carried him up into the upper chamber, there where he was lodging, and laid him on his bed.<verse eid="1KI 17:19"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:20"/>And Eliou cried out and said, "Alas O Lord, the witness of the widow, her with whom I am staying, you have done evil by putting to death her son."<verse eid="1KI 17:20"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:21"/>And he breathed on the lad three times and called on the Lord and said, "O Lord my God, let this lad's life now come into him again."<verse eid="1KI 17:21"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:22"/>And it happened thus, and the lad cried out.<verse eid="1KI 17:22"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:23"/>And he brought him down from the upper chamber into the house and gave him to his mother, and Eliou said, "See, your son is alive."<verse eid="1KI 17:23"/>

<verse sid="1KI 17:24"/>And the woman said to Eliou, "Behold, I know that you are a divine man and that a word of the Lord in your mouth is true."<verse eid="1KI 17:24"/>

<_X_chapter sid="1KI 18">
<verse sid="1KI 18:1"/>And it happened after many days that a word of the Lord came to Eliou in the third year, saying, "Go, and appear to Achaab, and I will give rain on the surface of the earth."<verse eid="1KI 18:1"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:2"/>And Eliou went to appear to Achaab. And the famine was severe in Samaria.<verse eid="1KI 18:2"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:3"/>And Achaab summoned Abdiou the steward. (And Abdiou was one who revered the Lord greatly,<verse eid="1KI 18:3"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:4"/>and it happened, when Iezabel smote the prophets of the Lord, that Abdiou took a hundred men, prophets, and hid them by fifty to a cave and kept providing them with bread and water.)<verse eid="1KI 18:4"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:5"/>And Achaab said to Abdiou, "Come, and let us pass through the land to springs of water and to wadis, if perhaps we may find grass and keep the horses and mules alive, and none of the animals will be destroyed."<verse eid="1KI 18:5"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:6"/>And they divided for themselves the way to pass through it; Achaab went in one direction alone, and Abdiou went in another direction alone.<verse eid="1KI 18:6"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:7"/>And Abdiou was on the way alone, and Eliou came to meet him alone, and Abdiou hastened and fell on his face and said, "Are you he, my lord Eliou?"<verse eid="1KI 18:7"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:8"/>And Eliou said to him, "It is I; go, say to your lord, Behold, Eliou."<verse eid="1KI 18:8"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:9"/>And Abdiou said, "What have I sinned, that you give your slave into the hand of Achaab, to put me to death?<verse eid="1KI 18:9"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:10"/>The Lord your God lives, if there is a nation or kingdom to which my lord has not sent to seek you, and they said, 'He is not here,' and he set fire to the kingdom and its regions, because it had not found you.<verse eid="1KI 18:10"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:11"/>And now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, Behold, Eliou.'<verse eid="1KI 18:11"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:12"/>And it will be if I depart from you, that a spirit of the Lord will carry you into a land that I know not, and I will go in to tell Achaab, and he will kill me, and your slave is one who reveres the Lord from his youth.<verse eid="1KI 18:12"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:13"/>Has it not been told to you my lord what I have done when Iezabel killed the prophets of the Lord, that I hid some of the Lord's prophets, a hundred men, by fifty to a cave, and provided them with loaves and water?<verse eid="1KI 18:13"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:14"/>And now you say to me, 'Go, say to your lord, Behold Eliou,' and he will kill me."<verse eid="1KI 18:14"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:15"/>And Eliou said, "The Lord of hosts lives before whom I stand, for I will appear to him today."<verse eid="1KI 18:15"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:16"/>And Abdiou went to meet Achaab and told him, and Achaab ran forth and came to meet Eliou.<verse eid="1KI 18:16"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:17"/>And it happened, when Achaab saw Eliou, that Achaab said to Eliou, "Are you he who perverts Israel?"<verse eid="1KI 18:17"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:18"/>And Eliou said, "I am not perverting Israel, but you and your father's house, when you forsook the Lord, your God, and went after the Baalim.<verse eid="1KI 18:18"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:19"/>And now send, assemble all Israel for me at Mount Carmel, and the four hundred fifty prophets of shame and the four hundred prophets of the groves, since they eat at Iezabel's table."<verse eid="1KI 18:19"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:20"/>And Achaab sent to all Israel and gathered all the prophets at Mount Carmel.<verse eid="1KI 18:20"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:21"/>And Eliou came near to all, and Eliou said to them, "How long will you go limping on both legs? If the Lord is God, go after him, but if Baal is he, go after him." And the people did not answer a word.<verse eid="1KI 18:21"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:22"/>And Eliou said to the people, "I all alone am left over as prophet of the Lord, and Baal's prophets number four hundred fifty men, and the prophets of the grove, four hundred.<verse eid="1KI 18:22"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:23"/>Let them give us two bulls, and let them choose the one for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, and let them put on no fire, and I will do the other bull and will put on no fire.<verse eid="1KI 18:23"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:24"/>And shout in the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the Lord, my God, and it will be, the god who answers by fire, he is God." And all the people answered and said, "The word which you spoke is good!"<verse eid="1KI 18:24"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:25"/>And Eliou said to the prophets of shame, "Choose for yourselves the one bull calf, and do it first, for you are many, and call on the name of your god, and put on no fire."<verse eid="1KI 18:25"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:26"/>And they took the bull calf and did it and were calling on the name of Baal from morning until noon and said, "Hear us, O Baal, hear us!" And there was no voice, and there was no hearing, and they ran about on the altar that they made.<verse eid="1KI 18:26"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:27"/>And it happened at noon that Eliou the Thesbite mocked them and said, "Call in a loud voice! For he is a god, for prating<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">18:27</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'meditation'</char></note> occupies him, and at the same time he is perhaps giving an oracle, or perhaps he is asleep and will get up."<verse eid="1KI 18:27"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:28"/>And they were calling in a loud voice and, as was their custom, they were cutting themselves with daggers and lances until the blood gushed out over them,<verse eid="1KI 18:28"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:29"/>and they were acting the prophet until evening came. And it happened, as it was the time for the sacrifice to ascend and there was no voice, that Eliou the Thesbite spoke to the prophets of the offenses, saying, "Stand aside for the present, and I will do my whole burnt offering," and they stood aside and departed.<verse eid="1KI 18:29"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:30"/>And Eliou said to the people, "Come closer to me," and all the people came closer to him.<verse eid="1KI 18:30"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:31"/>And Eliou took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of Israel, as the Lord had spoken to him, saying, "Israel shall be your name,"<verse eid="1KI 18:31"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:32"/>and he built the stones in the name of the Lord and repaired the altar that had been thrown down and made a thaala around the altar, holding two measures of seed.<verse eid="1KI 18:32"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:33"/>And he piled up the firewood on the altar that he made and cut the whole burnt offering in pieces and laid it on the firewood and piled it on the altar.<verse eid="1KI 18:33"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:34"/>And he said, "Take for me four jars of water, and pour it on the whole burnt offering and on the firewood," and they did so. And he said, "Do it a second time," and they did it a second time. And he said, "Do it a third time," and they did it a third time.<verse eid="1KI 18:34"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:35"/>And the water ran all around the altar, and filled the thaala<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">18:35</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'trench'</char></note> with water.<verse eid="1KI 18:35"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:36"/>And Eliou cried aloud to heaven and said, "O Lord, God of Abraam and Isaak and Israel, heed me, O Lord, heed me today with fire, and let all this people know that you are Lord, God of Israel, and I am your slave, and I have done these works on your account.<verse eid="1KI 18:36"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:37"/>Heed me, O Lord, heed me with fire, and let this people know that you are Lord God and that you turned the heart of this people back."<verse eid="1KI 18:37"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:38"/>And fire from the Lord fell from heaven and consumed the whole burnt offering and the firewood and the water that was in the thaala and the stones, and the fire licked up the dust.<verse eid="1KI 18:38"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:39"/>And all the people fell on their face and said, "Truly the Lord is God; he is God."<verse eid="1KI 18:39"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:40"/>And Eliou said to the people, "Seize the prophets of Baal; do not let one of them escape." And they seized them, and Eliou brought them down to the wadi Kison and slaughtered them there.<verse eid="1KI 18:40"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:41"/>And Eliou said to Achaab, "Go up, and eat, and drink, for there is a sound of the feet of the rain."<verse eid="1KI 18:41"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:42"/>And Achaab went up to eat and to drink, and Eliou went up on Carmel and bowed down upon the earth and put his face between his knees.<verse eid="1KI 18:42"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:43"/>And he said to his lad, "Go up, and look the way of the sea." And the lad looked and said, "There is nothing." And Eliou said, "Now you-- go again seven times." And the lad returned seven times.<verse eid="1KI 18:43"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:44"/>And it happened at the seventh time, and behold, a little cloud-- like the sole of a person's foot-- bringing water. And he said, "Go up, and say to Achaab, 'Harness your chariot, and go down; do not let the rain overtake you.' "<verse eid="1KI 18:44"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:45"/>And it happened until thus and thus<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">18:45</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'until thus and thus':  Perhaps 'after a while'</char></note>, and the sky grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a heavy rain, and Achaab wept and went to Iezrael.<verse eid="1KI 18:45"/>

<verse sid="1KI 18:46"/>And the hand of the Lord was on Eliou, and he girded up his loins and ran in front of Achaab to Iezrael.<verse eid="1KI 18:46"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:1"/>(20:1) And Hader's son gathered all his force together and went up and laid siege against Samaria, and thirty-two kings with him and every horse and chariot, and they went up and laid siege against Samaria and fought against it.<verse eid="1KI 21:1"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:2"/>And he sent into the city to King Achaab of Israel<verse eid="1KI 21:2"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:3"/>and said to him, "This is what Hader's son says: Your silver and your gold are mine, and your wives and your children are mine."<verse eid="1KI 21:3"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:4"/>And the king of Israel answered and said, "As you spoke, O lord, king, I am yours, and all that is mine."<verse eid="1KI 21:4"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:7"/>And the king of Israel called all the elders, and said, "Indeed, know, and see that this man is seeking trouble, for he has sent to me concerning my wives and concerning my sons and concerning my daughters; my silver and my gold I did not keep back from him."<verse eid="1KI 21:7"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:8"/>And the elders and all the people said to him, "Do not listen, and do not consent."<verse eid="1KI 21:8"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:9"/>And he said to the messengers of Hader's son, "Say to your master: All things that you have sent to your slave about at first I will do, but this matter I cannot do." And the men left and returned word to him.<verse eid="1KI 21:9"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:10"/>And Hader's son sent back to him, saying, "This may the god do to me, and this may he add, if the dust of Samaria will suffice for foxes for all the people, for my footmen."<verse eid="1KI 21:10"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:11"/>And the king of Israel answered and said, "Let it suffice; let not the hunchback boast as he who is straight."<verse eid="1KI 21:11"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:12"/>And it happened, when he answered him this word, he was drinking, he and all the kings with him, in the booths, and he said to his servants, "Build a palisade!" And they placed a palisade against the city.<verse eid="1KI 21:12"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:13"/>And behold, one prophet came up to the king of Israel and said, "This is what the Lord says, Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will give it into your hand today, and you shall know that I am the Lord."<verse eid="1KI 21:13"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:14"/>And Achaab said, "By whom?" and he said, "This is what the Lord says, By the lads who serve the district governors." And Achaab said, "Who shall begin the battle?" And he said, "You."<verse eid="1KI 21:14"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:16"/>And he went out at noon, and Hader's son was drinking himself drunk in Sokchoth, he and the thirty-two kings allied with him.<verse eid="1KI 21:16"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:17"/>And the lads who served the district governors went out among the first. And they sent and reported to the king of Syria, saying, "Men have come out from Samaria."<verse eid="1KI 21:17"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:18"/>And he said to them, "If these have come out for peace, take them alive, and if they have come out for war, take them alive,<verse eid="1KI 21:18"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:19"/>and do not let the lads who serve the district governors come out of the city." And the force behind them<verse eid="1KI 21:19"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:20"/>smote, each the one beside him, and he repeated, each the one beside him, and Syria fled, and Israel pursued them, and Hader's son, king of Syria, escaped on a horse of a horseman.<verse eid="1KI 21:20"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:21"/>And the king of Israel went out and took all the horses and the chariots and struck a great blow in Syria.<verse eid="1KI 21:21"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:22"/>And the prophet approached the king of Israel and said, "Strengthen yourself, and consider, and see what you will do, for when the year turns, Hader's son, king of Syria, will come up against you."<verse eid="1KI 21:22"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:23"/>And the servants of the king of Syria said, "The God of Israel is a god of mountains and not a god of valleys, therefore he prevailed over us, but if we fight against them on level ground, then we shall prevail over them.<verse eid="1KI 21:23"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:24"/>And do this: send away the kings, each to their place, and put satraps in place of them,<verse eid="1KI 21:24"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:25"/>and we will exchange with you a form like the force that you have lost, both horse for horse and chariot for chariot, and we will fight against them on level ground, and we shall prevail over them." And he heeded their voice and did so.<verse eid="1KI 21:25"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:26"/>And it happened when the year turned that Hader's son mustered Syria and went up to Apheka for battle against Israel.<verse eid="1KI 21:26"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:27"/>And the sons of Israel mustered and went out to meet them, and Israel encamped opposite them like two flocks of goats, and Syria filled the country.<verse eid="1KI 21:27"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:28"/>And the man of God approached and said to the king of Israel, "This is what the Lord says, Because Syria said, 'The Lord the God of Israel is a god of mountains and not a god of the valleys,' I will give this great force into your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord."<verse eid="1KI 21:28"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:29"/>And they encamped opposite one another seven days, and it happened on the seventh day that the battle drew near, and Israel smote Syria, one hundred thousand foot soldiers in one day.<verse eid="1KI 21:29"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:30"/>And the rest fled into the city of Apheka, and the wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of the men that were left. And Hader's son fled and entered the house into the inner chamber of the bedroom.<verse eid="1KI 21:30"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:31"/>And he said to his servants, "I know that the kings of Israel are merciful kings; let us now put sackcloths around our waists and ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel, perhaps he will spare our lives."<verse eid="1KI 21:31"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:32"/>And they tied sackcloths around their waists and put ropes on their heads and said to the king of Israel, "Your slave, Hader's son, says, 'Indeed, let my soul live.' " And he said, "Is he still alive? He is my brother."<verse eid="1KI 21:32"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:33"/>And the men practiced ornithomancy, and they hastened and seized upon the word from his mouth and said, "Hader's son is your brother."

<verse sid="1KI 21:34"/>And he said to him, "I will restore to you the towns that my father took from your father, and you shall establish streets for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria, and I will send you off with a covenant." So he made a covenant with him and sent him off.<verse eid="1KI 21:34"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:35"/>And by a word of the Lord one person of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor, "Indeed, smite me!" And the person refused to smite him.<verse eid="1KI 21:35"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:36"/>And he said to him, "Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, behold, you will depart from me, and a lion will smite you." And he went out from him, and a lion found him and smote him.<verse eid="1KI 21:36"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:38"/>And the prophet departed and waited for the king of Israel along the road and bound his eyes with a bandage.<verse eid="1KI 21:38"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:39"/>And it happened, as the king was passing by, that he shouted to the king and said, "Your slave went out to the army for the battle, and behold, a man brought a man to me and said to me, 'Guard this man, but if escaping he escapes, then your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.'<verse eid="1KI 21:39"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:40"/>And it happened: your slave looked around here and there, and he was not." And the king of Israel said to him, "Behold, you have also slain the ambushes on my side."<verse eid="1KI 21:40"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:41"/>And he hastened and removed the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him that he was one of the prophets.<verse eid="1KI 21:41"/>

<verse sid="1KI 21:42"/>And he said to him, "This is what the Lord says, 'Because you carried off a man destined for destruction at your hand, your life shall also be for his life, and your people for his people.' "<verse eid="1KI 21:42"/>
