<verse sid="SUS 1:6"/>And cases from other cities would come to them.<verse eid="SUS 1:6"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:7"/>These men, when they saw a woman-- elegant in appearance, wife of their brother, one of the sons of Israel, named Sousanna daughter of Chelkias, wife of Ioakim-- walking about in her husband's orchard,<verse eid="SUS 1:7"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:8"/>and since they lusted after her,<verse eid="SUS 1:8"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:9"/>they diverted their mind and turned away their eyes in order not to look to heaven nor to remember to make right decisions<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:9</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'judgments'</char></note>.<verse eid="SUS 1:9"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:10"/>But both were transfixed<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:10</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'bedazzled'</char></note> by her, and one to the other pretended the opposite to the evil that possessed them because of her (nor did the woman know of this matter).<verse eid="SUS 1:10"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:12"/>And as soon as dawn would break, they would come and cheat one another, being anxious who should appear to her first and should speak to her.<verse eid="SUS 1:12"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:13"/>And lo, according to her custom, she was walking around. And the one elder had already come, and lo, the other arrived, and one questioned the other saying, "Why did you come out so early in the morning and not take me along?"<verse eid="SUS 1:13"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:14"/>And they acknowledged to one another each his distress.<verse eid="SUS 1:14"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:22"/>And the Judean lady said to them, "I know that if I do it, it is death for me, and if I do not, I will not escape your hands.<verse eid="SUS 1:22"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:23"/>But it would be better for me to fall into your hands by not doing it than to sin before the Lord."<verse eid="SUS 1:23"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:28"/>So the scoundrels turned away, uttering threats among themselves and lay in ambush so that they might have her put to death. And when they came to the city assembly, where they sojourned, all the sons of Israel who were there deliberated.<verse eid="SUS 1:28"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:29"/>And when the two elders and judges stood up they said, "Send for Sousanna daughter of Chelkias, who is the wife of Ioakim." So they immediately summoned her.<verse eid="SUS 1:29"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:30"/>Now, when the woman arrived with her own father and mother, even her servants and maids (who numbered five hundred) came and Sousanna's four children.<verse eid="SUS 1:30"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:31"/>Now the woman was very refined.<verse eid="SUS 1:31"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:32"/>And the scoundrels ordered to uncover her in order that they could be sated with lust for her beauty.<verse eid="SUS 1:32"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:33"/>And all those who were with her and all who knew her wept.<verse eid="SUS 1:33"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:34"/>Then after the elders and judges stood up, they placed their hands on her head.<verse eid="SUS 1:34"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:35"/>But her heart trusted in the Lord, her God, and when she lifted her head, she wept, saying to herself, (35a) "O Lord, everlasting God, you who know all things before their beginning, you know that I have not done what these men are maliciously alleging against me." And the Lord heeded her supplication.<verse eid="SUS 1:35"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:36"/>Then the two elders said, "We were walking around in her husband's orchard,<verse eid="SUS 1:36"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:37"/>and as we were going around the walk, we saw this woman resting with a man. And while we stood, we saw them having intercourse together.<verse eid="SUS 1:37"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:38"/>And they did not know that we stood there. Then we agreed together, saying, 'Let's find out who they are.'<verse eid="SUS 1:38"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:39"/>And as we approached we recognized her, but the young man fled, covered over.<verse eid="SUS 1:39"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:40"/>But when we had seized this woman, we asked her, 'Who is the man?'<verse eid="SUS 1:40"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:41"/>but she would not tell us who he was. These things we testify." And as they were elders and judges of the people, the whole assembly believed them.<verse eid="SUS 1:41"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:44"/>(44-45) And lo, there was an angel of the Lord as she was being taken off to be executed. And the angel, just as he was ordered, gave a spirit of understanding to a youth, being Daniel.<verse eid="SUS 1:44"/>

<verse _X_reasonEmpty="verseEmptyInThisTranslation" sid="SUS 1:45"/><char style="no">&amp;#x2013;</char><note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:45</char><char closed="false" style="ft">This verse is empty in this translation.</char></note><verse eid="SUS 1:45"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:48"/>Then Daniel parted the crowd, and after he stood among them, he said, "Are you such fools, O sons of Israel? Without examining or learning the plain truth, do you kill a daughter of Israel?<verse eid="SUS 1:48"/>

<verse _X_reasonEmpty="verseEmptyInThisTranslation" sid="SUS 1:49"/>&amp;#x2013;<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:49</char><char closed="false" style="ft">This verse is empty in this translation.</char></note><verse eid="SUS 1:49"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:51"/>And now, separate them far from one another for me so that I can test them." (51a) So, when they were separated, Daniel said to the assembly, "Now, have no regard that they are elders, saying, 'They would never lie!' But I will examine them according to what occurs to me."<verse eid="SUS 1:51"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:52"/>And he summoned one of them, and they brought the elder to the youth and Daniel to him, "Hear! Hear! You that have grown aged in wicked days, your sins have now come, which you have committed formerly,<verse eid="SUS 1:52"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:53"/>when you were entrusted to hear and to judge cases carrying a death sentence and you condemned the innocent while you were acquitting the guilty, though the Lord says, 'You shall not kill an innocent and righteous person.'<verse eid="SUS 1:53"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:54"/>Now, therefore, under what tree and at what sort of place of the orchard did you see them with one another?" And the impious one said, "Under a mastich."<verse eid="SUS 1:54"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:55"/>Then the youth said, "Truly you have lied to the detriment of your own soul, for this very day the angel of the Lord will split your soul."<verse eid="SUS 1:55"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:56"/>And after he had this one removed, he told them to bring the other to him. Then he also said to that one, "Why is your seed twisted, like that of Sidon, and not like that of Iouda? Beauty has deceived you [or paltry lust].<verse eid="SUS 1:56"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:57"/>And thus you used to treat the daughters of Israel, and they, being afraid, would have intercourse with you, but a daughter of Iouda did not tolerate bearing your sickness in lawlessness.<verse eid="SUS 1:57"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:58"/>Now, therefore, tell me: Under what tree and in what place of the garden did you catch them having intercourse together?" Then, he said, "Under an evergreen oak."<verse eid="SUS 1:58"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:59"/>And Daniel said, "Sinner! Now, the angel of the Lord stands with the sword until the people destroy you<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:59</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Greek = plural</char></note> so that he may saw you in pieces."<verse eid="SUS 1:59"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:60"/>(60-62) And the whole assembly shouted for the youth, how out of their own mouths he had established them both as false witnesses by their own admission. And as the law states explicitly, they did to them just as they had wickedly intended against their sister. And they silenced them and took them away and threw them into a ravine. Then the angel of the Lord threw fire in their midst. And guiltless blood was saved that day.<verse eid="SUS 1:60"/>

<verse _X_reasonEmpty="verseEmptyInThisTranslation" sid="SUS 1:61"/>&amp;#x2013;<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:61</char><char closed="false" style="ft">This verse is empty in this translation.</char></note><verse eid="SUS 1:61"/>

<verse sid="SUS 1:62"/>For this reason youths are beloved by Iakob, because of their simplicity. (62b) And as for us, let us watch out for young able sons. For youths will be pious, and a spirit of knowledge and understanding shall be with them forever and ever.<verse eid="SUS 1:62"/>
