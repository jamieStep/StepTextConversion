<verse sid="EZK 1:1"/>And it happened in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth of the month, and I was in the middle of the captivity by the river Chobar, and the heavens were opened, and I saw divine appearances.<verse eid="EZK 1:1"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:2"/>On the fifth of the month (this was the fifth year of the captivity of King Ioakim)<verse eid="EZK 1:2"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:3"/>and a word of the Lord came to the priest Iezekiel son of Bouzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chobar, (3) and the hand of the Lord came upon me.<verse eid="EZK 1:3"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:4"/>And I looked, and behold, a rising wind was coming out of the north, and a great cloud was in it, and radiance was all around it and fire flashing forth, and in the middle of it<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the wind'</char></note> was something like a sight of electrum in the middle of the fire, and radiance was in it<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'the wind' or 'the fire' or 'the gold'</char></note>.<verse eid="EZK 1:4"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:5"/>And in the middle was something like a likeness of four living beings, and this was their appearance: a human likeness was upon them,<verse eid="EZK 1:5"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:6"/>and one had four faces, and one had four wings.<verse eid="EZK 1:6"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:7"/>And their legs were straight, and their feet were winged, and there were sparks like flashing bronze, and their wings were nimble.<verse eid="EZK 1:7"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:8"/>And a human hand was underneath their wings on their four parts, and the faces of the four<verse eid="EZK 1:8"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:9"/>were not veering when they were going. Each was moving opposite their face.<verse eid="EZK 1:9"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:10"/>And as for the resemblance of their faces: there was a face of a human, and the four had a face of a lion on the right, and the four had a face of a calf on the left, and the four had a face of an eagle.<verse eid="EZK 1:10"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:11"/>And the four had their wings, stretched out above. Each had two adjoined to each other, and two were covering up over their body.<verse eid="EZK 1:11"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:12"/>And each was moving according to its face. Wherever was the spirit as it moved, they were moving and were not veering.<verse eid="EZK 1:12"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:13"/>And in the middle of the living beings was an appearance like burning coals of fire, as the look of torches coming together between the living beings, and a radiance of the fire, and lightning was issuing from the fire.<verse eid="EZK 1:13"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:15"/>And I looked, and behold, the four had one wheel on the ground, close to the living beings.<verse eid="EZK 1:15"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:16"/>And the aspect of the wheels was like the aspect of tharsis<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:16</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'topaz'</char></note>, and the four had one likeness, and their construction was just as if a wheel was within a wheel.<verse eid="EZK 1:16"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:17"/>They were moving upon their four parts, and they were not veering when they were moving,<verse eid="EZK 1:17"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:18"/>nor were their backs, and they had height, and I looked at them, and the four had their backs full of eyes all around.<verse eid="EZK 1:18"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:19"/>And when the living beings were moving, the wheels were moving next to them, and when the living beings rose from the ground, the wheels were raised.<verse eid="EZK 1:19"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:20"/>Wherever was the cloud, there was the spirit to move; the living beings were moving, and the wheels were being raised with them, for a spirit of life was in the wheels.<verse eid="EZK 1:20"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:21"/>When the living beings were moving, they were moving, and when the living beings stopped, they stopped, and when the living beings rose from the ground, they were raised with them, for a spirit of life was in the wheels.<verse eid="EZK 1:21"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:22"/>And over the head of the living beings, they had a likeness just like a firmament-- like a sight of ice-- stretched out on their wings from above.<verse eid="EZK 1:22"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:23"/>And under the firmament, their wings were stretched out, flapping, one against the other. Each had two wings covering over their bodies.<verse eid="EZK 1:23"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:24"/>And when they were moving, I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of abundant water, and when they were pausing, their wings were resting.<verse eid="EZK 1:24"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:25"/>And behold, a voice from above the firmament that was over their heads.<verse eid="EZK 1:25"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:26"/>Like an appearance of a lapis lazuli stone was the likeness of a throne upon it, and on the likeness of the throne was a likeness just as a form of a human above.<verse eid="EZK 1:26"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:27"/>And I saw something like the view of electrum from the appearance of the loin and up, and from the appearance of the loin and all the way down, I saw something like an appearance of fire, and its radiance was all around.<verse eid="EZK 1:27"/>

<verse sid="EZK 1:28"/>Like an appearance of a bow whenever it is in the cloud in a day of rain, so was the vision of the radiance all around.<verse eid="EZK 1:28"/>

<verse sid="EZK 2:2"/>And a spirit came upon me and took me up and raised me and set me upon my feet, and I heard him speaking to me,<verse eid="EZK 2:2"/>

<verse sid="EZK 3:24"/>And a spirit came upon me and set me on my feet, and he spoke to me and said to me: Enter, and be closed in within your house.<verse eid="EZK 3:24"/>

<verse sid="EZK 3:25"/>As for you, son of man, behold, bands have been given upon you, and they shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out from their midst.<verse eid="EZK 3:25"/>

<verse sid="EZK 3:26"/>And I will bind fast your tongue, and you shall be made mute, and to them you shall not be as a man who reproves, for it is an embittering house.<verse eid="EZK 3:26"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:1"/>And a word of the Lord came to me, saying:<verse eid="EZK 17:1"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:2"/>Son of man, tell a tale, and speak an illustration to the house of Israel,<verse eid="EZK 17:2"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:3"/>and you shall say: This is what the Lord says: The great eagle with great wings, large in extent, full of talons, who has the guidance<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">17:3</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'has the guidance':  I.e. 'is led'</char></note> to enter into Lebanon. And he took the select parts of the cedar;<verse eid="EZK 17:3"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:4"/>he broke off the tender tops. And he carried them to the land of Chanaan; he set them into a walled city.<verse eid="EZK 17:4"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:5"/>And he took from the seed of the earth and gave it into the plain. A plant by abundant water, he set it out as something gazed upon.<verse eid="EZK 17:5"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:6"/>And it sprouted and turned into a weak vine, small in size for it to appear. Its shoots were upon it, and its roots were under it. And it turned into a vine and made layers and extended its climbers.<verse eid="EZK 17:6"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:7"/>And another great eagle came with great wings and many talons. And behold, this vine was wrapped around him, and its roots were against him. And it shot out its shoots toward him to water it<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">17:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the vine'</char></note> together with the bed of its planting.<verse eid="EZK 17:7"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:8"/>Into a good plain by abundant water it thrives so as to make shoots and to bear fruit, to be as a large vine.<verse eid="EZK 17:8"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:9"/>Therefore, say: This is what the Lord says: Will it go straight? Will not its tender roots and fruit rot, and all that first sprouts from it wither? And not by a great arm nor by many people so as to pull it from its roots.<verse eid="EZK 17:9"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:10"/>And behold, it thrives; will it actually go straight? Shall it not be withered in dryness as soon as the scorching wind touches it? It shall wither together with the clump of its sprouting.<verse eid="EZK 17:10"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:11"/>And a word of the Lord came to me, saying:<verse eid="EZK 17:11"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:12"/>Son of man, say now to the embittering house: Did you not understand what these things were? Say: When the king of Babylon comes upon Ierou-salem, he shall also take its king and its rulers and bring them to himself to Babylon.<verse eid="EZK 17:12"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:13"/>And he shall take the offspring of the reign<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">17:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'offspring of the reign':  I.e.

<verse sid="EZK 17:15"/>And he shall rebel against him so as to send out his own ambassadors to Egypt, that he might give him horses and many people. Shall he go straight? Shall he who produces opposition escape? And when he transgresses a covenant, shall be saved?<verse eid="EZK 17:15"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:16"/>I live, says the Lord, if he shall not come to an end in the place where the king is who made him king-- he who dishonored my imprecation and who transgressed my covenant-- with him in the midst of Babylon!<verse eid="EZK 17:16"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:18"/>And he dishonored oath-making so as to transgress a covenant, and behold, he has given his hand, and he did all these things to him. Shall he then be saved?<verse eid="EZK 17:18"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:19"/>Therefore, say: This is what the Lord says: I live, if I will not also impart upon his head my oath-making that he dishonored and my covenant that he transgressed!<verse eid="EZK 17:19"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:20"/>And I will spread out the net over him, and he shall be captured in its enclosure.<verse eid="EZK 17:20"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:21"/>In his every battle they shall fall by the sword, and I will disperse the survivors to every wind, and you shall recognize that I, the Lord, have spoken.<verse eid="EZK 17:21"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:22"/>Therefore, this is what the Lord says: And it is I who will take some from the select parts of the cedar; I will snip off something from the top of their heart. And it is I who will transplant on a high mountain.<verse eid="EZK 17:22"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:23"/>And I will hang him in a mountain of Israel high in the air. And I will transplant him, and he shall produce a shoot and bear fruit and become a large cedar. And every animal shall rest under him, and every winged creature shall rest under his shade, and his shoots shall be restored.<verse eid="EZK 17:23"/>

<verse sid="EZK 17:24"/>And all the trees of the plain shall know that I am the Lord, he who brings low a high tree and exalts a low tree and withers a green tree and makes a dry tree flourish. I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.<verse eid="EZK 17:24"/>

<verse sid="EZK 18:8"/>and shall not give his money for interest and shall not take excess and shall turn his hand back from injustice; he shall perform righteous judgment between a man and between his neighbor<verse eid="EZK 18:8"/>

<verse sid="EZK 18:9"/>and has walked by my ordinances and has kept my statutes so as to do them; this one is righteous, and he shall live by life, says the Lord.<verse eid="EZK 18:9"/>

<verse sid="EZK 18:10"/>And if he produces a pestiferous son who pours out blood and commits sinful acts,<verse eid="EZK 18:10"/>

<verse sid="EZK 18:11"/>he did not walk in the way of his righteous father, but he ate upon the mountains and defiled his neighbor's wife<verse eid="EZK 18:11"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:2"/>Therefore, prophesy, son of man; set your face toward Ierousalem, and gaze upon their holy things, and you shall prophesy against the land of Israel,<verse eid="EZK 21:2"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:3"/>and you shall say to the land of Israel: Behold, I am against you and will draw my hand-knife out of its sheath and will utterly destroy the unjust and the lawless from you.<verse eid="EZK 21:3"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:4"/>Because I will utterly destroy the unjust and the lawless from you, thus my hand-knife shall come out of its sheath against all flesh from the east wind to the north,<verse eid="EZK 21:4"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:5"/>and all flesh shall recognize that I, the Lord, have drawn my hand-knife out of its sheath. No longer shall it turn back.<verse eid="EZK 21:5"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:6"/>And you, son of man, sigh in the rubbing together of your loin, and in grief you shall groan before their eyes.<verse eid="EZK 21:6"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:7"/>And it shall be, if they say to you, "Why do you groan?" and you shall say, "Because of the news, for it comes, and every heart shall be enfeebled, and all hands shall be paralyzed, and all flesh and every spirit shall pass out, and all thighs shall be sullied with moisture." Behold, it comes, and it shall be, says the Lord.<verse eid="EZK 21:7"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:8"/>And a word of the Lord came to me, saying:<verse eid="EZK 21:8"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:9"/>Son of man, prophesy, and you shall say: This is what the Lord says, Say: O sword, O sword, be sharp and enraged.<verse eid="EZK 21:9"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:10"/>That you might slaughter victims, be sharp, that you might become aflashing, prepared for undoing. Slaughter; annihilate; expel every tree.<verse eid="EZK 21:10"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:11"/>And he gave it, ready for his hand to grasp; a sword was sharpened; it is ready to give it<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">21:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'Ierousalem'</char></note> into a slayer's hand.<verse eid="EZK 21:11"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:12"/>Shriek, and wail, son of man, because it came to be among my people; it is among all the leaders of Israel; they shall sojourn upon a sword; it came to be among my people; therefore, clap upon your hand.<verse eid="EZK 21:12"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:13"/>For it has been deemed just, and why, even if a tribe has been rejected? It shall not be, says the Lord.<verse eid="EZK 21:13"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:14"/>And as for you, son of man, prophesy, and clap hand upon hand. And double a sword; the third sword for casualties is the great sword for casualties. And it shall confound them,<verse eid="EZK 21:14"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:15"/>that the heart might be broken and the weak be multiplied upon every gate. They have been given over as victims of the sword. Good! It has come for slaying. Good! It has come for flashing.<verse eid="EZK 21:15"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:16"/>Go through, sharpen on right and on left, wherever your face may be aroused.<verse eid="EZK 21:16"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:17"/>But I too will clap my hand against my hand and will let loose my wrath; I, the Lord, have spoken.<verse eid="EZK 21:17"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:18"/>And a word of the Lord came to me, saying:<verse eid="EZK 21:18"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:19"/>And you, son of man, lay out for yourself two ways<verse eid="EZK 21:19"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:20"/>so that a sword of the king of Babylon might enter; the two will issue from one country, and a hand<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">21:20</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'signpost'</char></note> is at the beginning of the way of the city. (20) From the beginning of the way you shall lay it out so that a sword might come against Rabbath of the sons of Ammon and against Judea and against Ierousalem in its midst.<verse eid="EZK 21:20"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:21"/>For the king of Babylon shall stand upon the prime way, at the beginning of the two roads to practice<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">21:21</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'seek'</char></note> divination, to throw up a rod and to consult by carved objects<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">21:21</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'images'</char></note> and to inspect livers upon his right.<verse eid="EZK 21:21"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:22"/>And the oracular response came against Ierousalem, to throw up a palisade, to open wide a mouth in a shout, to raise up high a voice with a cry, to throw up a palisade against its gates and to put up a ramp and to build batteries of war-engines.<verse eid="EZK 21:22"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:23"/>And he shall be to them as one divining vain things before them, and he shall be as one recalling injustice to be seized.<verse eid="EZK 21:23"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:24"/>Therefore, this is what the Lord says: Because you recalled your injustices when your impieties were uncovered, that your sins be seen in all your impieties and in your practices-- because you recalled, you shall be captured by means of them.<verse eid="EZK 21:24"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:25"/>And as for you, profane, lawless leader of Israel, whose day has come, an end in a time of injustice,<verse eid="EZK 21:25"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:26"/>this is what the Lord says: Remove the turban, and put off the crown; this<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">21:26</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Antecedent unclear; possibly 'iniquity'</char></note> shall not be such. You abased that which is high and exalted that which is low.<verse eid="EZK 21:26"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:27"/>Injustice, injustice, I will make it! (But this shall not be such.) Until he comes to whom it is due, I will also give it over to him.<verse eid="EZK 21:27"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:28"/>And as for you, son of man, prophesy, and you shall say: This is what the Lord says to the sons of Ammon and to their reproach, and you shall say: A sword, a sword drawn for victims and drawn for completion. Rouse yourself that you may flash<verse eid="EZK 21:28"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:29"/>in your vain vision and in your divining of lies, to give you over onto necks of lawless wounded, whose day has come, an end in a time of injustice.<verse eid="EZK 21:29"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:30"/>Turn back, do not lodge in this place in which you were born; in your own land I will judge you,<verse eid="EZK 21:30"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:31"/>and I will pour out my indignation upon you. In a fire of my wrath I will breathe upon you and give you into hands of barbarian men as they devise destruction.<verse eid="EZK 21:31"/>

<verse sid="EZK 21:32"/>You shall be food in the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the earth. There will not be any memory of you, for I, the Lord, have spoken.<verse eid="EZK 21:32"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:1"/>And a word of the Lord came to me, saying:<verse eid="EZK 22:1"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:2"/>And you, son of man, will you judge the city of streams of blood? So declare to it all its lawless acts,<verse eid="EZK 22:2"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:3"/>and you shall say: This is what the Lord says: Oh city, shedding streams of blood in its midst so that its time might come and producing notions against it so as to defile it;<verse eid="EZK 22:3"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:4"/>by their streams of blood that you shed you have transgressed, and by your notions that you kept producing you were defiling yourself, and you brought your days near and brought a time of your years. Therefore, I have given you as a disgrace to the nations and for mockery to all the countries<verse eid="EZK 22:4"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:5"/>that come near to you and to those that are far from you, and they shall mock you: Your fame is unclean and great in lawless acts.<verse eid="EZK 22:5"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:6"/>Behold, the leaders of the house of Israel, each with his kindred-- they wallowed together in you so that they shed blood;<verse eid="EZK 22:6"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:7"/>they were reviling father and mother in you and dealing unjustly with the guest in you; they were oppressing orphan and widow in you,<verse eid="EZK 22:7"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:8"/>and they were despising my holy things and were profaning my sabbaths in you.<verse eid="EZK 22:8"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:9"/>Men were robbers in you so that they shed blood in you, and upon the mountains in you they ate; they were committing unholy acts in your midst.<verse eid="EZK 22:9"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:10"/>They uncovered a father's shame in you and were abasing a woman sitting apart in uncleanness in you.<verse eid="EZK 22:10"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:11"/>Each one with his neigh-bor's wife-- they would act lawlessly, and each would defile his bride in impiety, and each one his sister, a daughter of his father-- they would abase in you.<verse eid="EZK 22:11"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:12"/>In you, they would take bribes in order to shed blood; they would take interest and excess in you, and you completed a completion of your evil by oppression, and they forgot me says the Lord.<verse eid="EZK 22:12"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:13"/>If I will bring my hand upon my hand over what you have completed, that which you have done, and over your streams of blood that have come about in your midst,<verse eid="EZK 22:13"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:14"/>shall your heart endure? Shall your hands be strong in the days that I will act against you? I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do it.<verse eid="EZK 22:14"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:15"/>And I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you in the countries, and your uncleanness shall depart from you.<verse eid="EZK 22:15"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:16"/>And I will receive my heritage in you before the eyes of the nations, and you shall know that I am the Lord.<verse eid="EZK 22:16"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:17"/>And a word of the Lord came to me, saying:<verse eid="EZK 22:17"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:18"/>Son of man, behold, the house of Israel have all become to me mixed up with bronze and iron and tin and lead; in the midst of silver it is mixed up.<verse eid="EZK 22:18"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:19"/>Therefore, say: This is what the Lord says: Because you have become as one mixture, therefore, behold, I take you into the middle of Ierousalem.<verse eid="EZK 22:19"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:20"/>Just as silver and bronze and iron and tin and lead are taken into the middle of a furnace to blow fire into it to be melted, so I will take you in with my rage and gather and melt you,<verse eid="EZK 22:20"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:21"/>and I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst of it.<verse eid="EZK 22:21"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:22"/>As silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so you shall be melted in its midst, and you shall recognize that I, the Lord, poured out my wrath upon you.<verse eid="EZK 22:22"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:23"/>And a word of the Lord came to me, saying:<verse eid="EZK 22:23"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:24"/>Son of man, say to it: You are a land that is not rained upon, nor did rain come upon you in a day of indignation,<verse eid="EZK 22:24"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:25"/>whose leaders in its midst are like roaring lions catching prey, devouring souls with dominance, taking honors, and your widows have been multiplied in your midst.<verse eid="EZK 22:25"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:26"/>And its priests nullified my law and were profaning my holy things; they were making no distinction between holy and profane, and they were making no distinction between unclean and clean, and they were hiding their eyes from my sabbaths, and I was being profaned in their midst.<verse eid="EZK 22:26"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:27"/>Its rulers in its midst were like wolves catching prey to shed blood so that they gain through greed.<verse eid="EZK 22:27"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:28"/>And its prophets, while smearing<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">22:28</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'encouraging'</char></note> them, shall fall, while they behold idle things, giving lying divination, saying, "This is what the Lord says," and the Lord has not spoken,<verse eid="EZK 22:28"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:29"/>while they oppress the people of the land in injustice and committing robberies, oppressing poor and needy, and did not deal with judgment toward the guest.<verse eid="EZK 22:29"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:30"/>And I was seeking from them a man who behaved rightly and stood in front of me entirely in the time of the land so as not to wipe it out completely, and I did not find him.<verse eid="EZK 22:30"/>

<verse sid="EZK 22:31"/>And I poured out my ire upon it with the fire of my wrath to complete it; I have given their ways upon their heads, says the Lord.<verse eid="EZK 22:31"/>

<_X_chapter sid="EZK 23">
<verse sid="EZK 23:1"/>And a word of the Lord came to me, saying:<verse eid="EZK 23:1"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:2"/>Son of man, two woman were daughters of one mother,<verse eid="EZK 23:2"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:3"/>and they played the whore in Egypt in their youth; there their breasts fell; there they lost their virginity.<verse eid="EZK 23:3"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:4"/>And their names were Oola the elder and Ooliba her sister. And they became mine and bore sons and daughters. As for their names: Oola was Samaria, and Ooliba was Ierousalem.<verse eid="EZK 23:4"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:5"/>And Oola played the whore away from me and laid herself upon her lovers, upon the Assyrians who were coming near to her<verse eid="EZK 23:5"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:6"/>clothed in blue, governors and commanders. They were all elite young men, horsemen riding upon horses.<verse eid="EZK 23:6"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:7"/>And she granted her whoring to them; they were all the chosen sons of Assyrians, and she was defiling herself upon all, upon whom she laid herself, with all her notions.<verse eid="EZK 23:7"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:8"/>And she did not give up her whoring from Egypt, for they were lying with her in her youth, and they took her virginity and poured out their whoring upon her.<verse eid="EZK 23:8"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:9"/>Therefore, I gave her over into the hands of her lovers, into hands of the sons of Assyrians upon whom she was laying herself.<verse eid="EZK 23:9"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:10"/>They uncovered her shame; they took her sons and daughters and killed her by sword, and she became prattle for women, and they executed judgment against her upon her daughters.<verse eid="EZK 23:10"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:11"/>And her sister, Ooliba, saw and was corrupting her aggression beyond her and her whoring beyond the whoring of her sister.<verse eid="EZK 23:11"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:12"/>She applied herself to the sons of Assyrians, governors and commanders near her, wearing fine purple, horsemen riding upon horses. They were all elite young men.<verse eid="EZK 23:12"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:13"/>And I saw that she had been defiled, one way for the two.<verse eid="EZK 23:13"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:14"/>And she added to her whoring, and she saw men painted upon the wall, images of the Chaldeans, painted by brush,<verse eid="EZK 23:14"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:15"/>girded with brocades upon their loins and dyed tiaras on their heads; all had a triple aspect, a likeness of sons of Chaldeans of their native land.<verse eid="EZK 23:15"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:16"/>And she applied herself to them in the vision of her eyes and sent out messengers to them into the land of the Chaldeans.<verse eid="EZK 23:16"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:17"/>And the sons of Babylon came to her for a bed of lodgers, and they were defiling her in her whoring, and she was defiled with them, and her soul recoiled from them.<verse eid="EZK 23:17"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:18"/>And she uncovered her whoring and uncovered her shame, and my soul recoiled from her, as my soul recoiled from her sister.<verse eid="EZK 23:18"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:19"/>And you multiplied your whoring to remind them of the days of your youth when you whored in Egypt,<verse eid="EZK 23:19"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:20"/>and you applied yourself to the Chaldeans, whose flesh was like that of donkeys and their privates were privates of horses.<verse eid="EZK 23:20"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:21"/>And you reflected upon the lawlessness of your youth, what you used to do in Egypt in your lodging, where the breasts of your youth were.<verse eid="EZK 23:21"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:22"/>Therefore, O Ooliba, this is what the Lord says: Behold, I am rousing your lovers against you, those from whom your soul recoiled, and I will bring them against you from all around,<verse eid="EZK 23:22"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:23"/>sons of Babylon and all the Chaldeans, Phakoud and Soue and Koue and all the sons of Assyrians with them, elite young men, all leaders and commanders, triples<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">23:23</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'in threes'</char></note> and famed riders upon horses.<verse eid="EZK 23:23"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:24"/>All shall come against you from the north, chariots and wheelworks with a throng of people, oblong and small shields<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">23:24</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'and without a rim'</char></note>, and they shall cast a guard upon you all around.<verse eid="EZK 23:24"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:25"/>And I will give judgment in front of them, and they shall judge you with their judgment. And I will give my jealousy against you, and they shall deal with you in furious anger; they shall remove your nose and ears, and they shall throw down your remnants by the sword. They shall seize your sons and daughters, and fire shall devour your remnants.<verse eid="EZK 23:25"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:26"/>And they shall strip you of your clothing and seize the objects of your pride.<verse eid="EZK 23:26"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:27"/>And I will turn back your impieties from you and your whoring from the land of Egypt, and you shall not lift your eyes upon them, and you shall remember Egypt no longer.<verse eid="EZK 23:27"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:28"/>For this is what the Lord says: Behold, I am giving you into the hands of those whom you hate, those from whom your soul recoiled,<verse eid="EZK 23:28"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:29"/>and they shall deal with you in hatred and take away all your labors and hardships, and you shall be naked and debased, and the shame of your whoring shall be exposed, and your impiety. And your acts of whoring<verse eid="EZK 23:29"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:30"/>accomplished these things for you when you played the whore after nations and you were defiling yourself with their notions.<verse eid="EZK 23:30"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:31"/>You walked in the way of your sister, and I will give her cup into your hands.<verse eid="EZK 23:31"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:32"/>This is what the Lord says: You shall drink the cup of your sister, the deep and extra wide one to complete the intoxication,<verse eid="EZK 23:32"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:33"/>and you shall be filled with faintness. And the cup of annihilation is a cup of your sister, Samaria.<verse eid="EZK 23:33"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:34"/>And you shall drink it, and her feasts and new moons I will overturn, for I have spoken, says the Lord.<verse eid="EZK 23:34"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:35"/>Therefore, this is what the Lord says: Because you forgot me and threw me away behind your body, so, you, receive your impiety and your whoring.<verse eid="EZK 23:35"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:36"/>And the Lord said to me: Son of man, will you not judge Oola and Ooliba? And you shall declare to them their lawless acts,<verse eid="EZK 23:36"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:37"/>for they were committing adultery and blood was on their hands; they were committing adultery with their notions and they drove their children that they bore me through flames to them.<verse eid="EZK 23:37"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:38"/>While they did these things to me, they were defiling my holy things and profaning my sabbaths.<verse eid="EZK 23:38"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:39"/>And when they were slaughtering their children to their idols, they were also entering into my holy things to profane them. And it is that they would act thus in the midst of my house!<verse eid="EZK 23:39"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:40"/>And it was that, for the men who would come from afar (those to whom they would send out messengers) , even as soon as they would come, immediately you would bathe and would paint your eyes, and you would adorn yourself with adornment,<verse eid="EZK 23:40"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:41"/>and you would sit on a covered couch, and a table adorned in front of it<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">23:41</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the couch'</char></note>! And my incense and my oil would make merry among them.<verse eid="EZK 23:41"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:42"/>And they would strike up a sound of harmony for themselves. And to men from a multitude of humans, when they would come out of the wilderness-- they would also give bracelets upon their<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">23:42</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

'the women's'</char></note> heads.<verse eid="EZK 23:42"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:43"/>And I said: Do they not commit adultery with these? And with actions of a whore, she too played the whore.<verse eid="EZK 23:43"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:44"/>And they were entering into her; as they enter into a whoring woman, so they were entering into Oola and Ooliba to commit lawlessness.<verse eid="EZK 23:44"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:45"/>And righteous men themselves shall judge them with the retribution of an adulteress and with the retribution of blood, because they are adulteresses and blood is on their hands.<verse eid="EZK 23:45"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:46"/>This is what the Lord says: Bring up a throng against them, and impart tumult and plundering among them,<verse eid="EZK 23:46"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:47"/>and cast stones upon them with the stones from throngs, and pierce them with their rapiers; they shall kill their sons and daughters and set ablaze their houses with fire.<verse eid="EZK 23:47"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:48"/>And I will turn back impiety from the land, and all the women shall be educated and shall not act according to their impieties.<verse eid="EZK 23:48"/>

<verse sid="EZK 23:49"/>And your impiety shall be given against you, and you shall receive the sins of your notions, and you shall know that I am the Lord.<verse eid="EZK 23:49"/>

<verse sid="EZK 29:3"/>and say, This is what the Lord says: Behold, I am against Pharao, the great dragon who is ensconced in the midst of his streams and the one who says, "The streams are mine, and I made them."<verse eid="EZK 29:3"/>

<verse sid="EZK 29:4"/>And I will give snares into your jaws and glue the fish of your stream to your fins. And I will bring up you and all the fish of your stream from the midst of your stream.<verse eid="EZK 29:4"/>

<verse sid="EZK 29:5"/>And I will fling you and all the fish of your stream down with speed; upon the surface of the plain you shall fall, and you shall not be gathered and shall not be interred. I have given you to the animals of the earth and to the birds of the air for food.<verse eid="EZK 29:5"/>

<verse sid="EZK 29:6"/>And all who inhabit Egypt shall know that I am the Lord, because you became a rod of reed for the house of Israel.<verse eid="EZK 29:6"/>

<verse sid="EZK 29:7"/>When they seized you with their hands, you were crushed, and when every hand prevailed over them and when they rested upon you, you were shattered, and you broke every loin of theirs.<verse eid="EZK 29:7"/>

<verse sid="EZK 29:19"/>This is what the Lord says: Behold, I am giving to Nabouchodonosor, king of Babylon, the land of Egypt, and he shall foray for its booty and seize its spoils, and there shall be a wage for his force.<verse eid="EZK 29:19"/>

<verse sid="EZK 29:20"/>In return for his ministry, which he slaved against Tyre, I have given him the land of Egypt. This is what the Lord says:<verse eid="EZK 29:20"/>
