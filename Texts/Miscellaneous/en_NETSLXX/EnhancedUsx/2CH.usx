<verse sid="2CH 1:1"/>And Salomon son of Dauid prevailed over his kingdom, and the Lord his God was with him and magnified him highly.<verse eid="2CH 1:1"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:2"/>And Salomon spoke to all Israel, to the officers of thousands and the officers of hundreds and the judges and all the rulers before Israel, to the rulers of the paternal families.<verse eid="2CH 1:2"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:3"/>And Salomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high ground that is in Gabaon, there where God's tent of witness was, which Moyses, servant of the Lord, had made in the wilderness.<verse eid="2CH 1:3"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:4"/>But Dauid had carried God's ark up from the city of Kariathiarim, for he had prepared a tent for it in Ierousalem.<verse eid="2CH 1:4"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:5"/>And the bronze altar, which Besaleel son of Ourias son of Hor had made, was there before the Lord's tent, and Salomon and the assembly sought it out.<verse eid="2CH 1:5"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:6"/>And there Salomon offered on the bronze altar in the tent before the Lord and offered on it a thousand whole burnt offerings.<verse eid="2CH 1:6"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:7"/>In that night God appeared to Salomon and said to him, "Ask what I should give you."<verse eid="2CH 1:7"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:8"/>And Salomon said to God, "You have done great mercy with Dauid my father and have made me king in his stead.<verse eid="2CH 1:8"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:9"/>And now, Lord God, let your name be confirmed over Dauid my father, because it is you who have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth.<verse eid="2CH 1:9"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:10"/>Now grant me wisdom and understanding, and I will go out and will go in before this people, because who will judge this great people of yours?"<verse eid="2CH 1:10"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:11"/>And God said to Salomon, "Since this was in your heart and you have not asked for wealth of possessions nor glory, nor have you asked for the life of your opponents and for many days, and you have asked for wisdom and understanding for yourself in order to judge my people, those over whom I have made you king,<verse eid="2CH 1:11"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:12"/>I grant you wisdom and understanding, and I will give you both wealth and possessions and glory, as there has been none like you among the kings before you, and after you it shall not be so."<verse eid="2CH 1:12"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:13"/>And Salomon came from Bama in Gabaon to Ierousalem from before the tent of witness and ruled over Israel.<verse eid="2CH 1:13"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:14"/>And Salomon gathered together chariots and horsemen, and he had one thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. And he stationed them in the chariot cities, and the people were with the king in Ierousalem.<verse eid="2CH 1:14"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:15"/>And the king placed gold and silver in Ierousalem like stones and the cedars in Judea, like mulberry trees that are in the plain in abundance.<verse eid="2CH 1:15"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:16"/>And the export of Salomon's horses was from Egypt, and the price of the king's merchants; they would buy to trade.<verse eid="2CH 1:16"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:17"/>And they would go up and bring back from Egypt one chariot for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for one hundred and fifty. And thus they would bring for all the kings of the Chettites and kings of Syria by their hands.<verse eid="2CH 1:17"/>

<verse sid="2CH 1:18"/>(2.1) And Salomon said that he would build a house for the Lord's name and a house for his reign.<verse eid="2CH 1:18"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:1"/>(2) And Salomon gathered seventy thousand men and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hill country, and the supervisors over them were three thousand six hundred.<verse eid="2CH 2:1"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:2"/>(3) And Salomon sent to Chiram, king of Tyre, saying, "As you dealt with my father Dauid and dispatched to him cedars to build a house for him to dwell in,<verse eid="2CH 2:2"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:3"/>(4) behold, I, his son, also am building a house for the name of the Lord, my God, to dedicate it to him to offer incense before him and presentation<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:3</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

<verse sid="2CH 2:4"/>(5) And the house, which I am building, is great, for great is our God compared with all the gods.<verse eid="2CH 2:4"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:5"/>(6) And who will be able to build him a house?-- because the sky and the sky of the sky cannot bear his glory. And who am I to build him a house?-- except to offer incense before him.<verse eid="2CH 2:5"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:6"/>(7) And now send me a skilled man and one who knows how to work in gold and in silver and in bronze and in iron and in purple and in scarlet and in blue, one who understands to engrave engraving, with the skilled men who are with me in Ioudas and in Ierousalem, whom my father Dauid provided.<verse eid="2CH 2:6"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:7"/>(8) And send me cedar wood and juniper and pine from Lebanon, for I know how your slaves know about cutting wood from Lebanon. See, your servants will be with my servants.<verse eid="2CH 2:7"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:8"/>(9) They will go to prepare me timber in abundance, for the house I am about to build will be great and glorious.<verse eid="2CH 2:8"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:9"/>(10) And see, I have given the workmen, those cutting wood, grain as food in payment to your servants twenty thousand kors, even twenty thousand kors<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:9</char><char closed="false" style="ft">', even twenty thousand kors':  Hebrew 1 kor = 220 liters</char></note> of barley and twenty thousand measures of wine and twenty thousand measures of oil."<verse eid="2CH 2:9"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:10"/>(11) And Chiram, king of Tyre, said in writing and dispatched to Salomon, "In his love for his people the Lord has granted you as king over them."<verse eid="2CH 2:10"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:11"/>(12) And Chiram said, "Blessed be the Lord, God of Israel, who made the heaven and the earth, who gave King Dauid a wise son and one who understands discretion and understanding, who will build a house to the Lord and a house for his reign.<verse eid="2CH 2:11"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:12"/>(13) "Now I have sent you a skilled man and one endowed with understanding, Chiram my father--<verse eid="2CH 2:12"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:13"/>(14) his mother was of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a Tyrian man-- since he knows how to work in gold and in silver and in bronze and in iron, in stone and wood and to weave in purple and in blue and in linen and in scarlet and to engrave engravings and to visualize any design, whatever you give him, together with your skilled men and the skilled men of Dauid my lord, your father.<verse eid="2CH 2:13"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:14"/>(15) And now, let him send to his servants the grain and the barley and the oil and the wine of which my lord spoke.<verse eid="2CH 2:14"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:15"/>(16) And we on our part shall cut wood from Lebanon to meet your entire need and will transport it on rafts to the sea of Joppe, and you will transport it to Ierousalem."<verse eid="2CH 2:15"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:16"/>(17) And Salomon gathered all the men, the guests, in the land of Israel after the census, which his father Dauid had conducted of them, and they were found to be one hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred.<verse eid="2CH 2:16"/>

<verse sid="2CH 2:17"/>(18) And of them he made seventy thousand into porters and eighty thousand into stonecutters and three thousand six hundred taskmasters over the people.<verse eid="2CH 2:17"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:1"/>And in the seventh year Iodae gained strength and took the officers of hundreds, Azarias son of Ioram and Ismael son of Ioanan and Azarias son of Obed and Maasaias son of Adaias and Elisaphas son of Zacharias, with him into a house.<verse eid="2CH 23:1"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:2"/>And they went round Ioudas and gathered the Leuites from all the cities of Ioudas and the rulers of the paternal families of Israel and came to Ierousalem.<verse eid="2CH 23:2"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:3"/>And all the assembly of Ioudas made a covenant with the king in the house of God, and he showed to them the king's son and said to them, "Behold, let the king's son be king, as the Lord has spoken concerning the house of Dauid.<verse eid="2CH 23:3"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:4"/>Now this is the plan you will do. Let one third of you, of the priests and the Leuites, proceed on the sabbath and to the gates of the entrances,<verse eid="2CH 23:4"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:5"/>and let one third be in the king's house, and let one third be at the middle gate, and all the people are in the courts of the Lord's house.<verse eid="2CH 23:5"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:6"/>And let no one enter the Lord's house except the priests and the Leuites and those of the Leuites who are ministering. They shall enter because they are holy, and let all the people keep the Lord's watches.<verse eid="2CH 23:6"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:9"/>And he distributed the daggers and the shields and the arms which had belonged to King Dauid in the house of God.<verse eid="2CH 23:9"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:10"/>And he appointed all the people, each with his arms, from the right angle of the house to the left angle of the altar, and the house, in a ring around the king.<verse eid="2CH 23:10"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:11"/>And he led out the king's son and bestowed the crown upon him, and the testimonies. And Iodae and his sons made him king and anointed him and said, "Let the king live!"<verse eid="2CH 23:11"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:12"/>And Gotholia heard the sound of the people, those who ran and acknowledged and praised the king and approached the king in the house of the Lord.<verse eid="2CH 23:12"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:13"/>And she looked, and, behold, there was the king at his station and at the entrance the rulers and the trumpets around the king, and all the people were glad, and they trumpeted with the trumpets and the singers singing with their instruments and hymning a song of praise. And Gotholia tore her garment and exclaimed and said, "Attacking you are launching an attack."<verse eid="2CH 23:13"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:14"/>And Iodae the priest went out, and Iodae the priest commanded the officers of hundreds and commanders of the force and said to them, "Remove her from the house, and follow her, and let her die by dagger," because the priest said, "Let her not die in the house of the Lord."<verse eid="2CH 23:14"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:15"/>And they gave her leave, and she exited through the cavalry gate of the king's house, and there they put her to death.<verse eid="2CH 23:15"/>

<verse sid="2CH 23:18"/>And Iodae the priest put his hand to the works of the Lord's house through priests and Leuites and re-established the daily divisions of the priests and the Leuites, which Dauid had appointed for the house of the Lord and to offer whole burnt offerings to the Lord, as it is written in the law of Moyses, with gladness and with songs, through the hand of Dauid.<verse eid="2CH 23:18"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:1"/>Ioas was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years in Ierousalem. And his mother's name was Sabia from Bersabee.<verse eid="2CH 24:1"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:2"/>And Ioas did what was right before the Lord all the days of Iodae the priest.<verse eid="2CH 24:2"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:3"/>And Iodae took for him two wives, and he fathered sons and daughters.<verse eid="2CH 24:3"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:4"/>And it happened afterwards that it came into Ioas's heart to restore the house of the Lord.<verse eid="2CH 24:4"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:5"/>And he gathered the priests and Leuites and said to them, "Go out into the cities of Ioudas, and gather money from all Israel to restore the Lord's house, year by year, and hurry to spread the word." But the Leuites did not hurry.<verse eid="2CH 24:5"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:6"/>And King Ioas summoned Iodae the chief and said to him, "Why have you not exercised oversight concerning the Leuites, to bring in from Ioudas and Ierousalem what was determined by Moyses, man of God, when he assembled Israel into the tent of witness?"--<verse eid="2CH 24:6"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:7"/>because Gotholia was the lawless one, and her sons laid waste the house of God and furthermore made over to the she-Baalim all the holy things of the Lord's house.<verse eid="2CH 24:7"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:8"/>And the king said, "Let there be a chest, and let it stand outside the gate to the Lord's house."<verse eid="2CH 24:8"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:9"/>And they proclaimed in Ioudas and Ierousalem that people should bring an offering to the Lord, as Moyses servant of God had mentioned for Israel in the wilderness.<verse eid="2CH 24:9"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:10"/>And all the rulers and all the people gave and brought and dropped into the chest until it was full.<verse eid="2CH 24:10"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:11"/>And it happened, as they would bring the chest to the king's officials by means of the Leuites and as they saw that the money had increased, the king's scribe and the official of the great priest also came and emptied the chest and set it back in its place. This is how they acted day after day, and they collected much money.<verse eid="2CH 24:11"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:12"/>And the king and Iodae the priest gave it to those doing the work for the work of the Lord's house. And they hired masons and carpenters to restore the Lord's house and smiths of iron and copper to restore the Lord's house.<verse eid="2CH 24:12"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:13"/>And those doing the work kept on working, and the extent of their work expanded by their hands, and they raised up the Lord's house in its position and strengthened it.<verse eid="2CH 24:13"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:14"/>And when they had finished, they brought the rest of the money to the king and Iodae, and they made utensils for the Lord's house, liturgical utensils for whole burnt offerings and gold and silver censers. And they offered whole burnt offerings in the Lord's house regularly all the days of Iodae.<verse eid="2CH 24:14"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:15"/>And Iodae grew old and full of days and died at the age of one hundred and thirty years at his death.<verse eid="2CH 24:15"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:16"/>And they buried him in the city of Dauid with the kings, because he had done goodness with Israel and with God and with his house.<verse eid="2CH 24:16"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:17"/>And it happened after Iodae's death that the rulers of Ioudas entered and did obeisance to the king. Then the king heeded them.<verse eid="2CH 24:17"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:18"/>And they abandoned the Lord, God of their fathers, and were subject to the Astartes and to the idols. And wrath came upon Ioudas and upon Ierousalem on that day.<verse eid="2CH 24:18"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:19"/>And he sent prophets to them to turn them back to the Lord, but they did not listen. And they bore witness against them, and they did not listen.<verse eid="2CH 24:19"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:20"/>And a divine spirit entered Azarias the son of Iodae the priest, and he stood above the people and said, "This is what the Lord says: Why do you transgress the Lord's commandments? And you will not prosper. Because you have abandoned the Lord, he will also abandon you."<verse eid="2CH 24:20"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:21"/>And they plotted against him and stoned him by command of King Ioas in the court of the Lord's house.<verse eid="2CH 24:21"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:22"/>And Ioas did not remember the mercy that Iodae his father had done with him, and he put his son to death. And as he was dying, he said, "May the Lord see, and let him judge."<verse eid="2CH 24:22"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:23"/>And it happened after the completion of the year, the Syrian force came up against him and came against Ioudas and against Ierousalem, and they destroyed all the rulers of the people among the people and sent all the plunder to the king of Damascus.<verse eid="2CH 24:23"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:24"/>Because the Syrian force arrived with few men, God also delivered into their hands a very large force, because they had abandoned the Lord, God of their fathers. And he executed many judgments against Ioas.<verse eid="2CH 24:24"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:25"/>And after they had withdrawn from him, when they abandoned him in great infirmities, his servants also plotted against him because of the bloodshed of the son of Iodae the priest, and they put him to death on his bed. And he died. And they buried him in the city of Dauid, and they did not bury him in the tomb of the kings.<verse eid="2CH 24:25"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:26"/>And those plotting against him were Zabed the son of Samath the Ammanite and Iozabed the son of Somaroth the Moabite.<verse eid="2CH 24:26"/>

<verse sid="2CH 24:27"/>And all his sons, even the five, came against him. And the rest, behold, it is written in the document of the kings. And Amasias his son became king in his stead.<verse eid="2CH 24:27"/>

<verse sid="2CH 25:1"/>When he was twenty-five years old Amasias became king and reigned twenty-nine years in Ierousalem. And his mother's name was Ioaden from Ierousalem.<verse eid="2CH 25:1"/>

<verse sid="2CH 25:4"/>And he did not kill their sons according to the covenant of the Lord's law, as it is written, as the Lord had commanded, saying, "Fathers shall not die because of children, and sons shall not die because of fathers, but each shall die for his own sin."<verse eid="2CH 25:4"/>

<verse sid="2CH 25:5"/>And Amasias gathered the house of Ioudas and appointed them as officers of thousands and officers of hundreds according to their paternal families in all Ioudas and Ierousalem.

<verse sid="2CH 25:10"/>And Amasias discharged the force that had come to him from Ephraim to return to their place. And they were very angry with Ioudas and returned to their place in fierce anger.<verse eid="2CH 25:10"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:3"/>And he took counsel with his elders and the magnates to seal off the waters of the springs that were outside the city, and they supported him.<verse eid="2CH 32:3"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:4"/>And he gathered a large group of people and sealed off the waters of the springs and the stream that separated the city, saying, "May the king of Assour not come and find much water and be revived."<verse eid="2CH 32:4"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:5"/>And Hezekias strengthened and built the entire wall that had been demolished and towers and another external wall, and he strengthened the retaining structure of the city of Dauid and fashioned many weapons.<verse eid="2CH 32:5"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:6"/>And he set war commanders over the people, and they gathered to him in the square of the ravine gate, and he spoke to their hearts, saying:<verse eid="2CH 32:6"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:7"/>"Be strong, and be manly. Do not be terrified from before the king of Assour and from before all the nation with him, because with us are more than with him.<verse eid="2CH 32:7"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:9"/>And after this, Sennacherim, king of the Assyrians, sent his servants to Ierousalem, and he himself was at Lachis, and all his army with him. And he sent to Hezekias, king of Ioudas, and to all Ioudas in Ierousalem, saying,<verse eid="2CH 32:9"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:10"/>"Thus says Sennacherim, king of the Assyrians: In what<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">32:10</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'whom'</char></note> have you put your trust, that you sit in the siege in Ierousalem?<verse eid="2CH 32:10"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:12"/>Was it not this Hezekias who removed his altars and his high places and said to Ioudas and the inhabitants of Ierousalem, saying, 'Opposite this altar you shall do obeisance and upon it you shall offer incense'?<verse eid="2CH 32:12"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:13"/>Shall you not know what I have done, I and my fathers, to all the peoples of the countries? Being able were the gods of the nations of all the earth able to save their people from my hand?<verse eid="2CH 32:13"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:17"/>And he wrote a note to reproach the Lord, God of Israel, and spoke about him, saying, "As the gods of the nations of the earth did not deliver their peoples from my hand, so Hezekias' God will not deliver his people from my hand."<verse eid="2CH 32:17"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:18"/>And he shouted with a loud voice in Judean to the people of Ierousalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and draw them down in order that they might seize the city.<verse eid="2CH 32:18"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:19"/>And he talked about Ierousalem's God as he did about the gods of the peoples of the earth: works of human hands.<verse eid="2CH 32:19"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:20"/>And King Hezekias and the prophet Esaias son of Amos prayed about this and shouted out to the sky.<verse eid="2CH 32:20"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:21"/>And the Lord sent an angel, and he destroyed every powerful warrior and commander and general in the camp of Assour's king, and he returned to his country shame-faced.

<verse sid="2CH 32:23"/>And many brought gifts to the Lord in Ierousalem and presents to Hezekias, king of Ioudas, and he was exalted in the eyes of all the nations after that.<verse eid="2CH 32:23"/>

<verse sid="2CH 32:24"/>In those days Hezekias became sick unto death. And he prayed to the Lord, and he heard him and gave him a sign.<verse eid="2CH 32:24"/>

<verse sid="2CH 33:3"/>And he turned and built the high places that his father Hezekias had pulled down and erected steles to the she-Baalim and made groves and did obeisance to all the host of the sky and was subject to them.<verse eid="2CH 33:3"/>

<verse sid="2CH 33:4"/>And he built altars in the Lord's house of which the Lord had said, "In Ierousalem shall my name be forever."<verse eid="2CH 33:4"/>

<verse sid="2CH 33:6"/>He too passed his children through fire in Gai-Banai-ennom, and he acted as a diviner and practiced ornithomancy and sorcery and acted as ventriloquists and enchanters. He multiplied doing evil before the Lord in order to provoke him.<verse eid="2CH 33:6"/>

<verse sid="2CH 33:7"/>And he installed what was carved and what was smelted, an image that he had made, in the Lord's house of which God had said to Dauid and to Salomon his son, "In this house and Ierousalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever.<verse eid="2CH 33:7"/>

<verse sid="2CH 33:9"/>And Manasses led astray Ioudas and the inhabitants of Ierousalem to do what was evil beyond all the nations whom the Lord had removed from before the sons of Israel.<verse eid="2CH 33:9"/>
