<verse sid="NUM 11:7"/>Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance was the appearance of rock-crystal.<verse eid="NUM 11:7"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:12"/>Was it I who carried in the womb all this people, or was it I who gave birth to them, that you are saying to me, 'Take them to your bosom, as a nurse might take up the sucking child,' into the land, which you swore to their fathers?<verse eid="NUM 11:12"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:13"/>From where do I get meat to give to all this people? For they are weeping to me, saying, 'Give us meat so that we may eat!'<verse eid="NUM 11:13"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:14"/>I shall not be able to bear this people alone, because this thing is too heavy for me.<verse eid="NUM 11:14"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:16"/>And the Lord said to Moyses, "Gather for me seventy men from the elders of Israel, whom you personally know that they are elders of the people and are their scribes, and you shall lead them to the tent of witness, and they shall stand there with you.<verse eid="NUM 11:16"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:17"/>And I will come down and speak there with you, and I will remove some of the spirit that is upon you, and I will place it upon them, and they shall assist you with the onslaught of the people, and you will not bear them alone.<verse eid="NUM 11:17"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:18"/>And you shall say to the people: Purify yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you wept before the Lord, saying, 'Who shall feed us with meat?

<verse sid="NUM 11:20"/>up to a month of days you shall eat until it comes out of your nostrils and shall become as cholera to you, because you disobeyed the Lord who is among you and you wept before him, saying, 'What did we do, to come out of Egypt?'"<verse eid="NUM 11:20"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:21"/>And Moyses said, "The people whom I am among are six hundred thousand on foot-- and you said, 'Meat I will give them, and they will eat for a month of days'!<verse eid="NUM 11:21"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:22"/>Shall sheep and cattle really be slain for them, and will this be enough for them? Or shall all the food of the sea be gathered together for them, and will this be enough for them?"<verse eid="NUM 11:22"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:23"/>And the Lord said to Moyses, "Will the Lord's hand not be sufficient? Now you shall know whether my word will overtake you or not."<verse eid="NUM 11:23"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:24"/>And Moyses went out and spoke to the people the words of the Lord, and he gathered seventy men from the elders of the people, and he placed them around the tent.<verse eid="NUM 11:24"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:25"/>And the Lord came down in a cloud and spoke to him and took away some of the spirit that was upon him and put it upon the seventy men who were elders. Now as the spirit rested upon them, they also prophesied, and they no longer added.<verse eid="NUM 11:25"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:26"/>And two men were left in the camp, the name of the one Eldad and the name of the second Modad, and the spirit rested upon them. And these were among the ones who had been registered, and they did not go to the tent, and they prophesied in the camp.<verse eid="NUM 11:26"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:27"/>And the young man ran out and reported to Moyses and spoke, saying, "Eldad and Modad are prophesying in the camp."<verse eid="NUM 11:27"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:28"/>And Iesous the son of Naue, the one who stood by Moyses, the chosen one, said, "O Sir Moyses-- stop them!"<verse eid="NUM 11:28"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:29"/>And Moyses said to him, "Are you really jealous for me? And who might grant that all the Lord's people be prophets, when the Lord grants his spirit upon them?"<verse eid="NUM 11:29"/>

<verse sid="NUM 11:30"/>And Moyses departed into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.<verse eid="NUM 11:30"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:4"/>And when Moyses heard it, he fell face down,<verse eid="NUM 16:4"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:5"/>and he spoke to Kore and to all his congregation, saying, "God has enrolled, and he recognized the ones who are his and who are holy, and he brought them to himself, and those whom he chose for himself he brought to himself.<verse eid="NUM 16:5"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:8"/>And Moyses said to Kore, "Listen to me, sons of Leui!<verse eid="NUM 16:8"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:9"/>This is not a small thing for you, is it, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel and brought you to himself to minister in the services of the tent of the Lord and to stand by before the congregation to serve them?<verse eid="NUM 16:9"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:12"/>And Moyses sent to call Dathan and Abiron, sons of Eliab. And they said, "We are not coming up.<verse eid="NUM 16:12"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:13"/>This is not a small thing, is it, that you brought us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, since you rule over us as a ruler?<verse eid="NUM 16:13"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:25"/>And Moyses arose and went to Dathan and Abiron, and all the elders of Israel went together with him.<verse eid="NUM 16:25"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:35"/>And fire went out from the Lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the incense.<verse eid="NUM 16:35"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:36"/>And the Lord spoke to Moyses<verse eid="NUM 16:36"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:37"/>and to Eleazar the priest the son of Aaron: Take away the bronze fire-pans from the midst of those who have been burned up, and scatter this strange fire there, for they sanctified (38) the fire-pans of these sinners with their lives.<verse eid="NUM 16:37"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:38"/>And make them into hammered plates, a covering for the altar, because they were brought forward before the Lord and were sanctified and became a sign to the sons of Israel.<verse eid="NUM 16:38"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:39"/>And Eleazar son of Aaron the priest took the bronze fire-pans, as many as those who had been burned up brought forward, and they added them as a covering for the altar;<verse eid="NUM 16:39"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:41"/>And on the next day the sons of Israel complained against Moyses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the people of the Lord."<verse eid="NUM 16:41"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:42"/>And it came to pass, when the congregation ganged up against Moyses and Aaron, then they rushed headlong to the tent of witness, and this-- the cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared.<verse eid="NUM 16:42"/>

<verse sid="NUM 16:43"/>And Moyses and Aaron went in, in front of the tent of witness.<verse eid="NUM 16:43"/>

<verse sid="NUM 18:27"/>And your advance deductions shall be reckoned to you as grain from a threshing floor and as an advance deduction from a wine press.<verse eid="NUM 18:27"/>
