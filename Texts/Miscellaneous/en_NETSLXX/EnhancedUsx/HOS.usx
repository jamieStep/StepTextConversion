<verse sid="HOS 1:1"/>A word of the Lord that came to Hosee the son of Beeri in the days of Kings Ozias and Ioatham and Achaz and Hezekias of Ioudas and in the days of King Ieroboam son of Ioas of Israel.<verse eid="HOS 1:1"/>

<verse sid="HOS 1:2"/>The beginning of the word of the Lord in Hosee. And the Lord said to Hosee, "Go, take for yourself a wife of whoredom and children of whoredom, for the land in committing whoredom will commit whoredom from behind the Lord."<verse eid="HOS 1:2"/>

<verse sid="HOS 1:3"/>And he went and took Gomer daughter of Debelaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.<verse eid="HOS 1:3"/>

<verse sid="HOS 1:4"/>And the Lord said to him, "Call his name Iezrael, for in yet a little while I will also avenge the blood of Iezrael on the house of Ieou, and I will turn away the kingdom of the house of Israel.<verse eid="HOS 1:4"/>

<verse sid="HOS 1:5"/>And it shall be on that day, I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Iezrael."<verse eid="HOS 1:5"/>

<verse sid="HOS 1:6"/>And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And he said to him, "Call her name Not Pitied, for I will not any longer have pity on the house of Israel, but setting myself in opposition, I will oppose them.<verse eid="HOS 1:6"/>

<verse sid="HOS 1:7"/>But I will have pity on the sons of Ioudas, and I will save them by the Lord, their God, and I will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by chariots or by horses or by horsemen."<verse eid="HOS 1:7"/>

<verse sid="HOS 1:8"/>And she weaned Not Pitied and conceived again and bore a son.<verse eid="HOS 1:8"/>

<verse sid="HOS 1:9"/>And he said, "Call his name Not My People, for you are not my people and I am not your 'I am.' "<verse eid="HOS 1:9"/>

<verse sid="HOS 1:10"/>And the number of the sons of Israel was like the sand of the sea, which shall not be measured nor numbered, and it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, "You are not my people," they too shall be called, "sons of a living god."<verse eid="HOS 1:10"/>

<verse sid="HOS 1:11"/>And the sons of Ioudas and the sons of Israel shall be gathered together, and they shall set up for themselves one realm, and they shall go up from the land, for great shall be the day of Iezrael.<verse eid="HOS 1:11"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:1"/>Say to your brother, My People, and to your sister, Pitied.<verse eid="HOS 2:1"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:2"/>Contend against your mother, contend -- for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband-- and I will put away her whoring from before me and her adultery from between her breasts,<verse eid="HOS 2:2"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:3"/>that I might strip her naked and restore her as the day of her birth, and I will make her like a wilderness and render her as a parched land and kill her with thirst.<verse eid="HOS 2:3"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:4"/>And upon her children also I will have no pity, because they are children of whoredom.<verse eid="HOS 2:4"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:5"/>For their mother played the whore; she who bore them acted shamefully. For she said, "I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water and my clothes and my linen cloth and my oil and all the things proper for me."<verse eid="HOS 2:5"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:6"/>Therefore, behold, I am hedging up her way with thorns and will build up her ways, and she will not find her path.<verse eid="HOS 2:6"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:7"/>And she shall pursue her lovers and not overtake them, and she shall seek them and shall not find them. And she shall say, "I will go and return to my former husband, for it was well with me then rather than now."<verse eid="HOS 2:7"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:8"/>And she did not know that I had given her the grain and the wine and the oil and had multiplied silver to her. But she made the silver and the gold for the goddess Baal.<verse eid="HOS 2:8"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:9"/>Therefore I will return and carry off my grain in its time and my wine in its season, and I will take away my garments and my linen cloth, that she may not cover her shame.<verse eid="HOS 2:9"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:10"/>And now I will uncover her impurity before her lovers, and no one shall rescue her out of my hand.<verse eid="HOS 2:10"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:11"/>And I will turn away all her mirth, her feasts and her new moons and her sabbaths and all her public assemblies.<verse eid="HOS 2:11"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:12"/>And I will annihilate her vine and her fig trees of which she said, "These are my pay, which my lovers have given to me." And I will make them a witness, and the beasts of the field and the birds of the sky and the things that creep upon the earth shall devour them.<verse eid="HOS 2:12"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:13"/>And I will avenge the days of the Baalim on her, when she used to sacrifice to them and put on her earrings and her necklaces and go after her lovers but forgot me, says the Lord.<verse eid="HOS 2:13"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:14"/>Therefore, behold, I will deceive her and bring her down into the wilderness and speak to her heart.<verse eid="HOS 2:14"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:15"/>And from there I will give her her estates and the valley of Achor, to open up her understanding. And there she will be brought low as in the days of her infancy and as in the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.<verse eid="HOS 2:15"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:16"/>And it shall be on that day, says the Lord, she will call me "My husband" and no longer call me "Baalim."<verse eid="HOS 2:16"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:17"/>And I will remove the names of the Baalim from her mouth, and their names will be remembered no more.<verse eid="HOS 2:17"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:18"/>And I will make for them a covenant on that day with the animals of the field and with the birds of the sky and with the creeping things of the ground, and I will break bow and sword and war from the land, and I will make you dwell in hope.<verse eid="HOS 2:18"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:19"/>And I will betroth you to myself forever, and I will betroth you to myself in justice and in judgment and in mercy and in compassion.<verse eid="HOS 2:19"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:20"/>And I will betroth you to myself in faithfulness, and you shall know the Lord.<verse eid="HOS 2:20"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:21"/>And it shall be on that day, says the Lord, I will give heed to heaven, and it shall give heed to the earth,<verse eid="HOS 2:21"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:22"/>and the earth shall hear the grain and the wine and the oil, and they will give heed to Iezrael,<verse eid="HOS 2:22"/>

<verse sid="HOS 2:23"/>and I will sow her for myself in the land. And I will have pity on Not Pitied, and I will say to Not My People, "You are my people," and he shall say, "You are the Lord my God."<verse eid="HOS 2:23"/>

<verse sid="HOS 3:2"/>So I hired her to myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a gomor<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 homer = 220 liters</char></note> of barley and a nebel<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'skin'</char></note> of wine.<verse eid="HOS 3:2"/>

<verse sid="HOS 3:4"/>For the sons of Israel shall sit many days without king and without ruler and without sacrifice and without altar and without priestly office and without clear ones<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'clear ones':  Possibly 'explaining devices'</char></note>.<verse eid="HOS 3:4"/>

<_X_chapter sid="HOS 4">
<verse sid="HOS 4:1"/>Hear a word of the Lord, O sons of Israel, for the Lord has a dispute with the inhabitants of the land. For there is no truthfulness or mercy or knowledge of God in the land.<verse eid="HOS 4:1"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:2"/>Imprecation and lying and murder and stealing and adultery are poured out upon the land, and they mix blood with blood.<verse eid="HOS 4:2"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:3"/>Therefore the land shall mourn with all those who inhabit it, with the animals of the field and with the reptiles of the earth and with the birds of the air; even the fish of the sea shall fail,<verse eid="HOS 4:3"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:4"/>that no one either go to law or accuse. But my people will be like a priest being contradicted.<verse eid="HOS 4:4"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:5"/>And you shall be weak by day, and the prophet also shall be weak with you. I have made your mother like night.<verse eid="HOS 4:5"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:6"/>My people have become like one who lacks knowledge; because you have rejected knowledge, I also will reject you from being a priest to me. And you forgot the law of your God; I also will forget your children.<verse eid="HOS 4:6"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:7"/>According to their multitude, thus they sinned against me. I will turn their glory into dishonor.<verse eid="HOS 4:7"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:8"/>They will feed on the sins of my people, and they will receive their souls with their injustices.<verse eid="HOS 4:8"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:9"/>And it shall be as the people, so also the priest, and I will avenge on him his ways and repay him for his designs.<verse eid="HOS 4:9"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:10"/>And they shall eat and not be satisfied; they have played the whore and shall not prosper, for they forsook the Lord to cherish<verse eid="HOS 4:10"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:11"/>whoredom. And the heart of my people has received wine and intoxicating drink.<verse eid="HOS 4:11"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:12"/>They would consult counselors, and with his rods they would report to him. They were led astray by a spirit of whoredom, and they played the whore from their God.<verse eid="HOS 4:12"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:13"/>They were offering sacrifice on the tops of the mountains and were sacrificing upon the hills, under an oak and a white poplar and a thickly shading tree, because shelter is a good thing. Therefore your daughters will play the whore, and your daughters-in-law will commit adultery.<verse eid="HOS 4:13"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:14"/>And I will not take an interest in your daughters when they play the whore nor in your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, for the men themselves were associating with whores and were sacrificing with initiates, and the people, not understanding, embraced a whore.<verse eid="HOS 4:14"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:15"/>But you, O Israel, stop being ignorant, and you, O Ioudas, stop going to Galgala, and stop going up to the house of On, and stop swearing by the living Lord.<verse eid="HOS 4:15"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:16"/>For like a frenzied heifer, Israel went into a frenzy. Now the Lord will feed them like a lamb in a broad place.<verse eid="HOS 4:16"/>

<verse sid="HOS 4:17"/>Ephraim, an associate of idols, placed stumbling blocks against himself.<verse eid="HOS 4:17"/>
