<verse sid="ISA 1:1"/>A vision, which Esaias son of Amos saw-- which he saw against Judea and against Ierou-salem in the reign of Ozias and Ioatham and Achaz and Hezekias, who reigned over Judea.<verse eid="ISA 1:1"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:2"/>Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord has spoken: I begat sons and exalted them, but they rejected me.<verse eid="ISA 1:2"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:3"/>The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's crib, but Israel has not known me, and the people have not understood me.<verse eid="ISA 1:3"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:4"/>Ah, sinful nation, people full of sins, evil offspring, lawless sons, you have forsaken the Lord and provoked to anger the Holy One of Israel!<verse eid="ISA 1:4"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:5"/>Why should you be beaten anymore as you continue in lawlessness? Every head has become troubled, and every heart has become sad<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:5</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'Every head has become troubled, and every heart has become sad':  Or 'The whole head is pained, and the whole heart is sad.'</char></note>.<verse eid="ISA 1:5"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:6"/>From the feet to the head-- whether a sore or a bruise or a festering wound-- there is no emollient to put on, nor oil nor bandages.<verse eid="ISA 1:6"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:7"/>Your country lies desolate; your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence foreigners devour your land, and it has been made desolate, overthrown by foreign peoples.<verse eid="ISA 1:7"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:8"/>Daughter Sion will be forsaken like a booth in a vineyard and like a garden-watcher's hut in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.<verse eid="ISA 1:8"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:9"/>And if the Lord Sabaoth had not left us offspring, we would have become like Sodoma and been made similar to Gomorra.<verse eid="ISA 1:9"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:10"/>Hear the word of the Lord, you rulers of Sodoma! Pay attention to the law of God, you people of Gomorra!<verse eid="ISA 1:10"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:11"/>What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the Lord; I am full of whole burnt offerings of rams, and I do not want the fat of lambs nor the blood of bulls and goats--<verse eid="ISA 1:11"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:12"/>not even if you come<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'not even if you come':  Or 'neither shall you come'</char></note> to appear before me. For who asked these things from your hands? You shall trample my court no more!<verse eid="ISA 1:12"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:13"/>If you should offer fine flour, that would be futile; incense is an abomination to me. Your new moons and sabbaths and great day I cannot endure. Fasting and holidays<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'rest'; possibly 'idleness'</char></note>,<verse eid="ISA 1:13"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:14"/>as well as your new moons and your feasts, my soul hates. You have made me full<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'You have made me full':  Or 'You have become repugnant to me'</char></note>; I will no longer forgive your sins.<verse eid="ISA 1:14"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:15"/>When you stretch out your hands to me, I will turn away my eyes from you; even if you make many petitions, I will not listen to you, for your hands are full of blood.<verse eid="ISA 1:15"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:16"/>Wash yourselves; become clean; remove the evil deeds from your souls before my eyes; cease from your evil deeds;<verse eid="ISA 1:16"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:17"/>learn to do good; seek judgment; rescue the one who is wronged; defend the orphan, and do justice to the widow.<verse eid="ISA 1:17"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:18"/>So come, and let us argue it out, says the Lord: even though your sins are like crimson, I will make them white like snow, and though they are like scarlet, I will make them white like wool.<verse eid="ISA 1:18"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:19"/>And if you are willing and listen to me, you shall eat the good things of the land,<verse eid="ISA 1:19"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:20"/>but if you are not willing nor listen to me, the dagger will devour you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things.<verse eid="ISA 1:20"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:21"/>How the faithful city Sion has become a whore! She that was full of justice, wherein righteousness lodged-- but now murderers!<verse eid="ISA 1:21"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:22"/>Your silver has no value; your taverners mix the wine with water.<verse eid="ISA 1:22"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:23"/>Your rulers are disobedient: they are companions of thieves, loving gifts, running after a reward, not defending orphans and not paying attention to the widows' cause.<verse eid="ISA 1:23"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:24"/>Therefore this is what the Sovereign, the Lord Sabaoth, says: Ah, mighty ones of Israel! For my wrath on my adversaries will not abate, and I will exact judgment from my foes!<verse eid="ISA 1:24"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:25"/>And I will turn my hand against you and will burn you to bring about purity. But the disobedient I will destroy, and I will remove from you all the lawless and humble all who are arrogant.<verse eid="ISA 1:25"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:26"/>And I will set up your judges as at the former time and your counselors as at the beginning. And after these things you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful mother city, Sion.<verse eid="ISA 1:26"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:27"/>For her captivity shall be saved with judgment and with mercy.<verse eid="ISA 1:27"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:28"/>But the lawless and the sinners shall be crushed together, and those who forsake the Lord shall be brought to an end.<verse eid="ISA 1:28"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:29"/>For they shall be ashamed because of their idols, which they themselves wanted, and they were embarrassed because of their gardens, which they desired.<verse eid="ISA 1:29"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:30"/>For they shall be like a terebinth that has shed its leaves and like an orchard that has no water.<verse eid="ISA 1:30"/>

<verse sid="ISA 1:31"/>And their strength shall be like a stalk of flax, and their works like sparks of fire, and the lawless and the sinners shall be burned together, and there shall be no one to quench them.<verse eid="ISA 1:31"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:1"/>The word that came from the Lord to Esaias son of Amos concerning Judea and concerning Ierousalem.<verse eid="ISA 2:1"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:3"/>And many nations shall go and say, "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of the God of Iakob, and he will declare to us his way, and we will walk in it." For out of Sion shall go forth a law, and a word of the Lord from Ierousalem.<verse eid="ISA 2:3"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:4"/>And he shall judge between the nations and shall convict many people, and they shall beat their daggers into plows and their spears into pruning hooks, and no more shall nation take up dagger against nation, neither shall they learn to wage war any more.<verse eid="ISA 2:4"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:5"/>And now, O house of Iakob, come, let us walk by the light of the Lord!<verse eid="ISA 2:5"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:6"/>For he has abandoned his people, the house of Israel, because their country, like that of the allophyles, was filled with divinations as it had been at the beginning, and many allophyle children were born to them.<verse eid="ISA 2:6"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:7"/>For their country was filled with silver and gold, and there was no number to their treasures, and the land was filled with horses, and there was no number to their chariots.<verse eid="ISA 2:7"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:8"/>And the land was filled with abominations, the works of their hands, and they did obeisance to the things their own fingers had made.<verse eid="ISA 2:8"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:9"/>And so a person bowed down, and a man was humbled-- and I will not forgive them!<verse eid="ISA 2:9"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:10"/>And now enter into the rocks, and hide in the earth from before the fear of the Lord and from the glory of his strength, when he rises to crush the earth.<verse eid="ISA 2:10"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:11"/>For the eyes of the Lord are lofty, but man is lowly, and the loftiness of men shall be brought low, and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.<verse eid="ISA 2:11"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:12"/>For the day of the Lord Sabaoth will be against everyone who is insolent and haughty and against everyone who is lofty and high, and they shall be humbled,<verse eid="ISA 2:12"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:13"/>both against every cedar of Lebanon, of them that are lofty and high, and against every acorn tree<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'acorn tree':  I.e. the balanites aegyptiaca</char></note> of Basan,<verse eid="ISA 2:13"/>

<verse sid="ISA 2:20"/>On that day a man will throw away his silver and gold abominations, which they made to do obeisance to the vain ones and the bats<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:20</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'will throw away his silver and gold abominations, which they made to do obeisance to the vain ones and the bats':  Or 'will throw away to the vain ones and to the bats his silver and gold abominations, which they made to do obeisance to'</char></note>,<verse eid="ISA 2:20"/>

<verse sid="ISA 3:6"/>Because a man will seize his brother or his father's kinsman, saying, "You have a cloak; you be our leader, and let my food be under<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'supplied by'</char></note> you."<verse eid="ISA 3:6"/>

<verse sid="ISA 3:8"/>because Ierousalem has been abandoned and Judea has fallen and their tongues are joined with lawlessness, being disobedient toward the things of the Lord; now therefore their glory has been brought low.<verse eid="ISA 3:8"/>

<verse sid="ISA 3:9"/>And the shame of their face has risen up against them; they have proclaimed their sin like that of Sodoma, and they have made it plain. Woe to their soul! Because they have given evil counsel against themselves,<verse eid="ISA 3:9"/>

<verse sid="ISA 7:2"/>And it was reported to the house of Dauid, saying, "Aramaic has made an agreement with Ephraim."
