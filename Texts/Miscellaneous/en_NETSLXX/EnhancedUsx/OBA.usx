<verse sid="OBA 1:1"/>The Vision of Abdias. This is what the Lord God says to Idumea: I heard a report from the Lord, and he sent enclosing to the nations: "Rise up, and let us rise up against it for battle!"<verse eid="OBA 1:1"/>

<verse sid="OBA 1:2"/>Behold, I have made you least among the nations; you are very much dishonored.<verse eid="OBA 1:2"/>

<verse sid="OBA 1:3"/>The arrogance of your heart has raised you up, though you tent in the holes of the rocks, exalting his habitation, saying in his heart, "Who will bring me down to the ground?"<verse eid="OBA 1:3"/>

<verse sid="OBA 1:4"/>If you soar like an eagle, even if you set your nest among the stars, from there I will bring you down, says the Lord.<verse eid="OBA 1:4"/>

<verse sid="OBA 1:5"/>If thieves came to you, or robbers by night, where would you be cast aside; would they not steal what is sufficient for themselves? And if grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave gleanings?<verse eid="OBA 1:5"/>

<verse sid="OBA 1:6"/>How Esau was searched, and his hidden things seized.<verse eid="OBA 1:6"/>

<verse sid="OBA 1:11"/>Since the day you stood in opposition, on the day that aliens took captive his force and foreigners entered his gate and cast lots for Ierousalem, you too were like one of them.<verse eid="OBA 1:11"/>

<verse sid="OBA 1:12"/>And do not look upon a day of your brother, on the day of foreigners, and do not rejoice over the sons of Ioudas on the day of their ruin, and do not boast on the day of affliction.<verse eid="OBA 1:12"/>

<verse sid="OBA 1:13"/>Do not even enter the gates of the peoples on the day of their suffering nor look, even you, upon their gathering on the day of their ruin nor join in an attack on their force on the day of their destruction.<verse eid="OBA 1:13"/>

<verse sid="OBA 1:14"/>Do not even stand at their mountain passes, to destroy utterly their escapees nor hem in those among them who are attempting to flee on the day of affliction.<verse eid="OBA 1:14"/>

<verse sid="OBA 1:15"/>For the day of the Lord against all the nations is near. As you have done, so shall it be to you; your recompense shall be returned on your head.<verse eid="OBA 1:15"/>
