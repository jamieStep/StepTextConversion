  <chapter sid="EXO 1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:1"/>These are the names of the sons of Israel who had entered into Egypt with Iakob their father. Each with their whole household went in:<verse eid="EXO 1:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:2"/>Rouben, Symeon, Leui, Ioudas,<verse eid="EXO 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:3"/>Issachar, Zaboulon and Beniamin,<verse eid="EXO 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:4"/>Dan and Nephthali, Gad and Aser.<verse eid="EXO 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:5"/>But Ioseph was in Egypt. Now all souls from Iakob were seventy-five.<verse eid="EXO 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:6"/>Then Ioseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation.<verse eid="EXO 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:7"/>But the sons of Israel increased and multiplied and became common and were growing very, very strong. Now the land kept multiplying them.<verse eid="EXO 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:8"/>Now another king arose over Egypt, who did not know Ioseph.<verse eid="EXO 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:9"/>Now he said to his nation, "Look, the race of the sons of Israel is a great multitude and is becoming stronger than we.<verse eid="EXO 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:10"/>Come then, let us deal shrewdly with them, lest it be multiplied, and, whenever war happens to us, these also shall be added to the opponents, and after going to war against us, they shall depart from the land."<verse eid="EXO 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:11"/>And he set over them overseers of tasks in order to afflict them in the tasks. And they built fortified cities for Pharao, both Pithom and Ramesses and On, which is Heliopolis<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'Sun City'</char></note>.<verse eid="EXO 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:12"/>But as much as they were humbling them, by so much the more they kept becoming more numerous and stronger, and the Egyptians were disgusted with the sons of Israel.<verse eid="EXO 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:13"/>And the Egyptians were oppressing the sons of Israel forcefully<verse eid="EXO 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:14"/>and were grievously afflicting their life by the hard tasks in clay and brick making and all the tasks in the plains, according to all the tasks in which they were enslaving them with force.<verse eid="EXO 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:15"/>And the king of the Egyptians spoke to the Hebrews' midwives, to one of them whose name was Sepphora, and the name of the second was Phoua,<verse eid="EXO 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:16"/>and he said, "Whenever you act as midwives to the Hebrew women and they should be at the birthing stage, if then it be male, kill it, but if female, preserve it alive."<verse eid="EXO 1:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:17"/>But the midwives feared God, and they did not do as the king of Egypt instructed them and tried to keep the males alive.<verse eid="EXO 1:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:18"/>Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and said to them, "Why is it that you have done this thing and tried to keep the males alive?"<verse eid="EXO 1:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:19"/>The midwives then said to Pharao, "The Hebrew women are not like the women of Egypt, for they give birth before the midwives go in to them," and they were already giving birth.<verse eid="EXO 1:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:20"/>Now God was dealing well with the midwives, and the people kept on multiplying and becoming very strong.<verse eid="EXO 1:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:21"/>Because the midwives were fearing God, they made families for themselves.<verse eid="EXO 1:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 1:22"/>Then Pharao instructed all his people, saying, "Every male that might be born to the Hebrews, throw into the river, and every female, keep it alive."<verse eid="EXO 1:22"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:1"/>Now there was a certain man from the tribe of Leui who took one of the daughters of Leui and married her.<verse eid="EXO 2:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:2"/>And she conceived and bore a male child. Now when they saw it was handsome, they sheltered it for three months.<verse eid="EXO 2:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:3"/>But when they could hide it no longer, its mother took a basket and plastered it with a mixture of pitch and tar, and she put the child in it and placed it in the marsh beside the river.<verse eid="EXO 2:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:4"/>And his sister was watching from a distance to learn what would happen to him.<verse eid="EXO 2:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:5"/>Now Pharao's daughter came down to the river to bathe, and her attendants were walking beside the river. And when she saw the basket in the marsh, she sent her attendant, and she picked it up.<verse eid="EXO 2:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:6"/>Now when she opened it, she saw a child crying in the basket, and Pharao's daughter spared it and said, "This is one of the Hebrews' children."<verse eid="EXO 2:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:7"/>And his sister said to Pharao's daughter, "Do you wish that I summon for you a nursing woman from the Hebrews, and she shall suckle the child for you?"<verse eid="EXO 2:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:8"/>Then she, Pharao's daughter, said to her, "Go!" But the girl went and summoned the child's mother.<verse eid="EXO 2:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:9"/>And Pharao's daughter said to her, "Take care of this child for me, and suckle it for me, and I will give you your pay." Then the woman took the child and kept suckling it.<verse eid="EXO 2:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:10"/>Now when the child grew up, she brought it to Pharao's daughter, and it became to her for a son. And she named his name Moyses, saying, "I drew him out of the water."<verse eid="EXO 2:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:11"/>Now it came to pass in the course of those many days, when he had fully grown, Moyses went out to his brothers, the sons of Israel. And as he observed their toil, he saw an Egyptian man beating some Hebrew from his own brothers, the sons of Israel.<verse eid="EXO 2:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:12"/>Now when he looked around this way and that, he saw no one, and he struck the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.<verse eid="EXO 2:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:13"/>Now when he went out on the next day, he saw two Hebrew men fighting, and he said to the one who was in the wrong, "Why do you beat your fellow?"<verse eid="EXO 2:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:14"/>But he said, "Who appointed you ruler and judge over us? You do not intend to kill me, do you, in the same way you killed the Egyptian yesterday?" Then Moyses was afraid and said, "Has this matter perhaps become so well known?"<verse eid="EXO 2:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:15"/>Now Pharao heard about this matter, and he was seeking to kill Moyses. Then Moyses withdrew from Pharao's presence and settled in the land of Madian. Now when he came into the land of Madian, he sat upon the well.<verse eid="EXO 2:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:16"/>Now the priest of Madian had seven daughters who were tending their father's sheep. So when they arrived, they were drawing water until they filled the receptacles in order to water their father's sheep.<verse eid="EXO 2:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:17"/>But when the shepherds arrived, they were driving them away. But Moyses got up and rescued them and drew water for them and watered their sheep.<verse eid="EXO 2:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:18"/>Now they arrived back to Ragouel, their father, and he said to them, "Why is it that you were quick to arrive today?"<verse eid="EXO 2:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:19"/>And they said, "An Egyptian man rescued us from the shepherds and drew water for us and watered the sheep."<verse eid="EXO 2:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:20"/>And he said to his daughters, "And where is he? And for what reason have you left this man behind like this? Invite him then in order that he might eat bread."<verse eid="EXO 2:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:21"/>Now Moyses stayed with the man, and he gave Sepphora, his daughter, to Moyses for a wife.<verse eid="EXO 2:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:22"/>Now when she became pregnant, the woman bore a son, and Moyses called his name Gersam, saying, "Because I am a resident alien in a foreign land."<verse eid="EXO 2:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:23"/>Now after those many days the king of Egypt died, and the sons of Israel groaned from the tasks and cried out, and their cry rose up to God from the tasks.<verse eid="EXO 2:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:24"/>And God listened to their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraam and Isaak and Iakob.<verse eid="EXO 2:24"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 2:25"/>And God looked upon the sons of Israel, and he became known to them.<verse eid="EXO 2:25"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:1"/>And Moyses was tending the sheep of Iothor, his father-in-law, the priest of Madian, and he led the sheep beyond the wilderness and came to the mountain, Choreb.<verse eid="EXO 3:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:2"/>Now an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a fire of flame out of the bush, and he saw that the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not burning up.<verse eid="EXO 3:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:3"/>Then Moyses said, "When I pass by, I will look at this great sight, why it is that the bush is not burning up."<verse eid="EXO 3:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:4"/>Now when the Lord saw that he was drawing near to see, the Lord called him from the bush, saying, "Moyses, Moyses." And he said, "What is it?"<verse eid="EXO 3:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:5"/>And he said, "Do not come near here! Loose the sandal from your feet! For the place on which you are standing is holy ground."<verse eid="EXO 3:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:6"/>And he said to him, "I am the God of your father, God of Abraam and God of Isaak and God of Iakob." And Moyses turned his face away, for he was afraid to look down before God.<verse eid="EXO 3:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:7"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "When I looked, I saw the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry on account of the taskmasters. For I know their pain.<verse eid="EXO 3:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:8"/>And I came down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land and to bring them into a good and spacious land, into a land flowing with milk and honey, into the place of the Chananites and Chettites and Amorrites and Pherezites and Heuites and Gergesites and Iebousites.<verse eid="EXO 3:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:9"/>And now, look, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me, and I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.<verse eid="EXO 3:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:10"/>And now come, let me send you to Pharao, king of Egypt, and you will bring my people, the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 3:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:11"/>And Moyses said to God, "Who am I that I should go to Pharao, king of Egypt, and that I should bring the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt?"<verse eid="EXO 3:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:12"/>But God spoke to Moyses, saying, "I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you that I am sending you: when you have brought my people out of Egypt, you shall also serve God at this mountain."<verse eid="EXO 3:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:13"/>And Moyses said to God, "Look, I shall come to the sons of Israel and shall say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent me to you'; they will ask me, 'What is his name?' What shall I say to them?"<verse eid="EXO 3:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:14"/>And God said to Moyses, "I am The One Who Is." And he said, "Thus shall you say to the sons of Israel, 'The One Who Is has sent me to you.' "<verse eid="EXO 3:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:15"/>And God said again to Moyses, "Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel, 'The Lord, the God of your fathers, God of Abraam and God of Isaak and God of Iakob, has sent me to you.' This is an everlasting name of mine and a memorial of generations to generations.<verse eid="EXO 3:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:16"/>"Therefore, go, and assemble the elders' council of the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, 'The Lord, the God of your fathers, has appeared to me, God of Abraam and God of Isaak and God of Iakob, saying, "With concern I have concerned myself with you and what has happened to you in Egypt."<verse eid="EXO 3:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:17"/>And I said, "I will bring you up from the affliction of the Egyptians into the land of the Chananites and Chettites and Heuites and Amorrites and Pherezites and Gergesites and Iebousites, into a land flowing with milk and honey."'<verse eid="EXO 3:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:18"/>And they will listen to your voice, and you and the elders' council of Israel shall go in to Pharao, king of Egypt, and you shall say to him, 'The God of the Hebrews has summoned us. Therefore, let us go a three days' journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to our God.'<verse eid="EXO 3:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:19"/>Now I know that Pharao, king of Egypt, will not permit you to go, except with a mighty hand.<verse eid="EXO 3:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:20"/>And when I stretch out my hand, I will strike the Egyptians with all my wonders that I will perform among them, and after these things he will send you away.<verse eid="EXO 3:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:21"/>And I will give favor to this people before the Egyptians. Now whenever you depart, you will not go away empty-handed.<verse eid="EXO 3:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 3:22"/>But a woman will ask from a neighbor and tent mate of hers silver and gold articles and clothing, and you shall put them on your sons and on your daughters, and you shall plunder the Egyptians."<verse eid="EXO 3:22"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:1"/>Then Moyses answered and said, "If then they should not believe me or listen to my voice, for they will say, 'God has not appeared to you!' what shall I say to them?"<verse eid="EXO 4:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:2"/>Then the Lord said to him, "What is this in your hand?" And he said, "A rod."<verse eid="EXO 4:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:3"/>And he said, "Throw it on the ground!" And he threw it on the ground, and it became a snake, and Moyses fled from it.<verse eid="EXO 4:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:4"/>And the Lord said to Moyses, "Stretch out your hand, and seize the tail! (then he stretched out his hand and seized the tail, and it became a rod in his hand)<verse eid="EXO 4:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:5"/>-- so that they may believe you, that the Lord, the God of their fathers, God of Abraam and God of Isaak and God of Iakob, has appeared to you."<verse eid="EXO 4:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:6"/>Now the Lord said to him again, "Put your hand into your bosom!" And he put the hand into his bosom, and he brought his hand out of his bosom, and his hand became as snow.<verse eid="EXO 4:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:7"/>And he said, "Again put your hand into your bosom!" And he put the hand into his bosom and brought it out of his bosom, and again it was restored to the color of his flesh.<verse eid="EXO 4:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:8"/>"Now if they should not believe you or listen to the voice of the first sign, they will believe you because of the voice of the last sign.<verse eid="EXO 4:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:9"/>And it will be if they should not believe you for these two signs or listen to your voice, you shall take some of the river's water and pour it on the dry ground, and the water, whatever you take from the river, will be blood on the dry ground."<verse eid="EXO 4:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:10"/>But Moyses said to the Lord, "Please, Lord, I am incompetent-- before yesterday or the third day or since you began to speak to your attendant. I am weak-voiced and slow-tongued."<verse eid="EXO 4:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:11"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Who gave a mouth to a person, and who made him deaf and mute, seeing and blind? Is it not I, the Lord God?<verse eid="EXO 4:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:12"/>And now go, and I will open your mouth and teach you what you are going to speak."<verse eid="EXO 4:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:13"/>And Moyses said, "Please, Lord, appoint another capable person, whom you will send."<verse eid="EXO 4:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:14"/>And enraged with anger towards Moyses the Lord said, "Look, is not Aaron your brother, the Leuite? I know that when he speaks, he will speak for you. And look, he will come out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be glad in himself.<verse eid="EXO 4:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:15"/>And you shall speak to him and put my words in his mouth. And I will open your mouth and his mouth and will teach you what you shall do.<verse eid="EXO 4:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:16"/>And he shall speak for you to the people, and he shall be your mouth, but you shall be to him the things pertaining to God.<verse eid="EXO 4:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:17"/>And this rod, which was turned into a snake, you shall take in your hand, with which you shall perform the signs with it."<verse eid="EXO 4:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:18"/>Now Moyses went and returned to Iothor, his father-in-law, and said, "I shall go and return to my brothers in Egypt and see whether they are still living." And Iothor said to Moyses, "Go in health." Now after those many days the king of Egypt had died.<verse eid="EXO 4:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:19"/>And the Lord said to Moyses in Madian, "Go! Return to Egypt! For all those who were seeking your soul are dead."<verse eid="EXO 4:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:20"/>Then Moyses took his wife and children and put them on draft animals, and he went back to Egypt. And Moyses took the rod from God in his hand.<verse eid="EXO 4:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:21"/>And the Lord said to Moyses, "As you go and return to Egypt, see, all the wonders which I put in your hands, you shall perform them before Pharao. But I will harden his heart, and he will not send the people away.<verse eid="EXO 4:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:22"/>Then you shall say to Pharao, 'This is what the Lord says, "My firstborn son is Israel."<verse eid="EXO 4:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:23"/>And I said to you, "Send my people away so that they might serve me." Now then, if you are unwilling to send them away, see then, I will kill your firstborn son.'"<verse eid="EXO 4:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:24"/>Now it happened on the way at the lodging, an angel of the Lord met him and was seeking to kill him.<verse eid="EXO 4:24"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:25"/>And Sepphora took a pebble and circumcised the foreskin of her son, and she fell at his feet and said, "The blood of the circumcision of my child is staunched."<verse eid="EXO 4:25"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:26"/>And he went away from him, because she said, "The blood of the circumcision of my child is staunched."<verse eid="EXO 4:26"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:27"/>And the Lord said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness for a meeting with Moyses." And he went and met him at the mountain of God, and they kissed one another.<verse eid="EXO 4:27"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:28"/>And Moyses reported to Aaron all the words of the Lord that he sent and all the signs that he commanded him.<verse eid="EXO 4:28"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:29"/>Then Moyses and Aaron went and assembled the elders' council of the sons of Israel.<verse eid="EXO 4:29"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:30"/>And Aaron spoke all these words that God had spoken to Moyses and performed the signs before the people.<verse eid="EXO 4:30"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 4:31"/>And the people believed and were glad because God had observed the sons of Israel and because he had seen their oppression. Then the people bowed down and did obeisance.<verse eid="EXO 4:31"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:1"/>And after these things Moyses and Aaron went in to Pharao and said to him, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says, 'Send away my people so that they may celebrate a feast to me in the wilderness.' "<verse eid="EXO 5:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:2"/>And Pharao said, "Who is this whose voice I shall listen to so that I send away the sons of Israel? I do not know the Lord, and I am not sending Israel away!"<verse eid="EXO 5:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:3"/>And they say to him, "The God of the Hebrews has summoned us. We will travel then a three days' journey into the wilderness in order to sacrifice to our God, lest death or murder meet us."<verse eid="EXO 5:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:4"/>And the king of Egypt said to them, "Moyses and Aaron, why are you diverting my people from their tasks? Each of you, go back to his tasks."<verse eid="EXO 5:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:5"/>And Pharao said, "Look, the people of the land now are very numerous. Therefore, let us not give them relief from their tasks."<verse eid="EXO 5:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:6"/>Then Pharao instructed the people's taskmasters and recorders, saying,<verse eid="EXO 5:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:7"/>"No longer will straw continue to be given to the people for brick-making, as it was yesterday and the third day. Let them go themselves and gather straw for themselves.<verse eid="EXO 5:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:8"/>And the levy of brick-making that they themselves make each day, you shall impose on them; you shall not remove anything. For they have spare time! For this reason they have cried out, saying, 'Let us go and offer sacrifice to our God.'<verse eid="EXO 5:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:9"/>Let the tasks of these people be made heavy, and let them be preoccupied with these things and let them not be preoccupied by empty words."<verse eid="EXO 5:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:10"/>Then the taskmasters and recorders kept urging them on and telling the people, saying, "This is what Pharao says, 'I am no longer giving you straw.<verse eid="EXO 5:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:11"/>As you yourselves go, gather for yourselves straw wherever you may find it, for nothing is being removed from your levy.' "<verse eid="EXO 5:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:12"/>And the people were scattered in the whole of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.<verse eid="EXO 5:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:13"/>Now the taskmasters kept urging them on, saying, "Complete the customary tasks daily even as when the straw was being given to you."<verse eid="EXO 5:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:14"/>And the recorders of the race of the sons of Israel, who had been set over them by the overseers of Pharao, were beaten, saying, "Why did you not finish your levies of brick-making, just as yesterday and the third day, also today?"<verse eid="EXO 5:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:15"/>Then the recorders of the sons of Israel, they came in and cried out to Pharao, saying, "Why are you acting like this to your domestics?<verse eid="EXO 5:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:16"/>Straw is not being given to your domestics, and they tell us to make the brick, and look, your servants have been beaten. So you will treat your people unjustly."<verse eid="EXO 5:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:17"/>And he said to them, "You have spare time; you are men of leisure! For this reason you say, 'Let us go; let us offer sacrifice to our God.'<verse eid="EXO 5:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:18"/>Now then, go, and get to work! For the straw shall not be given to you, and you shall deliver the levy of brick-making."<verse eid="EXO 5:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:19"/>Now the recorders of the sons of Israel were seeing themselves in difficulties, because they were saying, "You shall not come short of the customary amount of brick-making daily."<verse eid="EXO 5:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:20"/>Now they met Moyses and Aaron coming to meet them, as they were going out from Pharao,<verse eid="EXO 5:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:21"/>and they said to them, "May God see you and judge, because you have made our smell loathsome before Pharao and before his attendants, to put a sword into his hands to kill us."<verse eid="EXO 5:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:22"/>Then Moyses turned to the Lord and said, "Lord, why did you harm this people? And why have you sent me?<verse eid="EXO 5:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 5:23"/>Even from the time when I have gone in to Pharao to speak in your name, he has harmed this people, and you have not delivered your people."<verse eid="EXO 5:23"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:1"/>And the Lord said to Moyses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharao. For by a mighty hand he will send them away, and by a raised arm he will drive them out of his land."<verse eid="EXO 6:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:2"/>Then God spoke to Moyses and said to him, "I am the Lord,<verse eid="EXO 6:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:3"/>and I appeared to Abraam and Isaak and Iakob, being their God, and my name, Lord, I did not make known to them.<verse eid="EXO 6:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:4"/>Also, I established my covenant with them in order to give them the land of the Chananites, the land of their sojourning, in which they also lived as sojourners on it.<verse eid="EXO 6:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:5"/>And I listened to the groaning of the sons of Israel, those whom the Egyptians are making into slaves, and I remembered your covenant.<verse eid="EXO 6:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:6"/>Go! Tell the sons of Israel, saying, 'I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from the domination of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from slavery, and I will redeem you by a raised arm and great judgment.<verse eid="EXO 6:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:7"/>And I will take you for myself, as my people, and I will be your God, and you shall know that I am the Lord, your God, who brought you out from the oppression of the Egyptians.<verse eid="EXO 6:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:8"/>And I will bring you into the land for which I stretched out my hand to give it to Abraam and Isaak and Iakob, and I will give it to you by allotment. I am the Lord.' "<verse eid="EXO 6:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:9"/>Then Moyses spoke in this way to the sons of Israel, and they did not listen to Moyses because of discouragement and the hard tasks.<verse eid="EXO 6:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:10"/>Then the Lord spoke to Moyses, saying,<verse eid="EXO 6:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:11"/>"Go in, tell Pharao, king of Egypt, to send away the sons of Israel from his land."<verse eid="EXO 6:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:12"/>Then Moyses spoke before the Lord, saying, "Look, the sons of Israel did not listen to me, and how will Pharao listen to me? Now, I am without eloquence."<verse eid="EXO 6:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:13"/>But the Lord spoke to Moyses and Aaron and gave them instructions for Pharao, king of Egypt, that he send the sons of Israel away from the land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 6:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:14"/>And these are the chiefs of the households of their ancestral lineages: sons of Rouben, firstborn of Israel: Henoch and Phallous, Hasron and Char-mi. This is the family of Rouben.<verse eid="EXO 6:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:15"/>And sons of Symeon: Iemouel and Iamin and Oad and Iachin and Saar and Saoul, the son of the Phoenician. These are the paternal lineages of the sons of Symeon.<verse eid="EXO 6:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:16"/>And these are the names of the sons of Leui according to their families: Gedson and Kaath and Merari. And the years of Leui's life were one hundred thirty-seven.<verse eid="EXO 6:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:17"/>And these are sons of Gedson: Lobeni and Semei, households of their paternal lineage.<verse eid="EXO 6:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:18"/>And sons of Kaath: Amram and Isaar, Chebron and Oziel. And the years of Kaath's life were one hundred thirty years.<verse eid="EXO 6:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:19"/>And sons of Merari: Mooli and Omousi. These are the households of Leui's ancestral lineages according to their families.<verse eid="EXO 6:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:20"/>And Amram took Iochabed, the daughter of his father's brother, for his own wife, and she bore him both Aaron and Moyses and Mariam, their sister. Now the years of Amram's life were one hundred thirty-six years.<verse eid="EXO 6:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:21"/>And sons of Isaar: Kore and Napheg and Zechri.<verse eid="EXO 6:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:22"/>And sons of Oziel: Misael and Elisaphan and Setri.<verse eid="EXO 6:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:23"/>Now Aaron took Elisabe, daughter of Aminadab, sister of Naasson, for his wife, and she bore him Nadab and Abioud and Eleazar and Ithamar.<verse eid="EXO 6:23"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 6:26"/>This is Aaron and Moyses whom God told to bring the sons of Israel out of Egypt with their host.<verse eid="EXO 6:26"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:27"/>These are the ones negotiating with Pharao, king of Egypt, and they brought the sons of Israel out of Egypt-- Aaron himself and Moyses.<verse eid="EXO 6:27"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:28"/>On the day in which the Lord spoke to Moyses in the land, Egypt,<verse eid="EXO 6:28"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:29"/>the Lord spoke to Moyses, saying, "I am the Lord. Say to Pharao, king of Egypt, what I am saying to you."<verse eid="EXO 6:29"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 6:30"/>And Moyses said before the Lord, "Look, I am weak-voiced, and how will Pharao listen to me?"<verse eid="EXO 6:30"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:1"/>And the Lord spoke to Moyses, saying, "Look, I have given you as a god to Pharao, and Aaron, your brother, shall be your prophet.<verse eid="EXO 7:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:2"/>Now you shall speak to him all things that I command you, and Aaron, your brother, shall tell Pharao so that he sends the sons of Israel away from his land.<verse eid="EXO 7:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:3"/>But I will harden Pharao's heart, and I will multiply my signs and wonders in the land, Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 7:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:4"/>And Pharao shall not listen to you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and I will bring out with my host my people, the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt with great vengeance.<verse eid="EXO 7:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:5"/>And all the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I stretch out the hand against Egypt, and I shall bring the sons of Israel out from their midst."<verse eid="EXO 7:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:6"/>And Moyses and Aaron did just as the Lord commanded them; so they did.<verse eid="EXO 7:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:7"/>Now Moyses was eighty years old, but Aaron, his brother, was eighty-three years old, when he spoke to Pharao.<verse eid="EXO 7:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:8"/>And the Lord spoke to Moyses and Aaron, saying,<verse eid="EXO 7:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:9"/>"And if Pharao should speak to you, saying, 'Give us a sign or wonder,' you also shall say to Aaron, your brother, 'Take the rod, and throw it upon the ground before Pharao and before his attendants, and it will be a dragon.' "<verse eid="EXO 7:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:10"/>Now Moyses and Aaron went in before Pharao and his attendants and did so just as the Lord commanded them. And Aaron threw down the rod before Pharao and before his attendants, and it became a dragon.<verse eid="EXO 7:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:11"/>And Pharao summoned the experts of Egypt and the sorcerers, and they also, the enchanters of the Egyptians, did likewise by their magical potions.<verse eid="EXO 7:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:12"/>And each one threw down his rod, and they became dragons, and the rod of Aaron swallowed the rods of those people.<verse eid="EXO 7:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:13"/>And the heart of Pharao prevailed, and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord spoke to them.<verse eid="EXO 7:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:14"/>Now the Lord said to Moyses, "The heart of Pharao is weighed down so as not to send away the people.<verse eid="EXO 7:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:15"/>Go to Pharao in the morning. Look, he himself is going out to the water, and you shall stand, meeting him on the bank of the river, and the rod that was turned into a snake you shall take in your hand.<verse eid="EXO 7:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:16"/>And you shall say to him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, "Send away my people so that they may serve me in the wilderness." And look, you did not listen up to this point.<verse eid="EXO 7:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:17"/>This is what the Lord says, "By this you shall know that I am the Lord. Look, with the rod that is in my hand I am about to strike upon the water that is in the river, and it shall turn to blood.<verse eid="EXO 7:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:18"/>And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall stink, and the Egyptians shall be unable to drink water from the river." '"<verse eid="EXO 7:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:19"/>Now the Lord said to Moyses, "Say to Aaron, your brother, 'Take your rod, and stretch out the hand over the waters of Egypt and over their rivers and over their canals and over their marshes and over all their accumulated water, and they shall be blood.' "And blood occurred in all the land of Egypt, both in things made from wood and things made from stone.<verse eid="EXO 7:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:20"/>And Moyses and Aaron did so just as the Lord commanded them, and Aaron lifted it up and with his rod struck the water that was in the river before Pharao and before his attendants, and all the water in the river turned into blood.<verse eid="EXO 7:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:21"/>And the fish in the river died, and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river, and there was blood in the whole land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 7:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:22"/>But also the Egyptians' enchanters did likewise with their magical potions. And Pharao's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord said.<verse eid="EXO 7:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:23"/>And Pharao turned and went into his house, and he did not put his mind even to this.<verse eid="EXO 7:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:24"/>Now all the Egyptians dug around the river so that they might drink water, and they could not drink water from the river.<verse eid="EXO 7:24"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 7:25"/>And seven days were completed after the Lord struck the river.<verse eid="EXO 7:25"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:1"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Go in to Pharao, and you will say to him, 'This is what the Lord says: Send away my people so that they may serve me.<verse eid="EXO 8:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:2"/>But if you are unwilling to send them away, look, I am going to strike all your borders with frogs.<verse eid="EXO 8:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:3"/>And the river shall vomit frogs, and when they come up, they shall enter into your houses and into the secret places of your bedrooms and upon your beds and into the houses of your attendants and your people and in your bread dough and in your ovens.<verse eid="EXO 8:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:4"/>And upon you and upon your attendants and upon your people the frogs shall come up.' "<verse eid="EXO 8:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:5"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Say to Aaron, your brother, 'Stretch out by hand your rod over the rivers and over the canals and over the marshes, and bring up the frogs.' "<verse eid="EXO 8:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:6"/>And Aaron stretched out the hand over the waters of Egypt and brought up the frogs. And the frog was made to come up and covered the land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 8:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:7"/>But also the Egyptians' enchanters did likewise with their magical potions, and they brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 8:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:8"/>Then Pharao called Moyses and Aaron and said, "Pray on my behalf to the Lord, and let him take away the frogs from me and from my people, and I will send away the people, and they may sacrifice to the Lord."<verse eid="EXO 8:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:9"/>Then Moyses said to Pharao, "Arrange for me when I should pray for you and for your attendants and your people, to remove the frogs from you and from your people and out of your houses-- only in the river shall they remain."<verse eid="EXO 8:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:10"/>And he said, "Tomorrow." He said, therefore, "As you have said so that you may know that there is no other except the Lord.<verse eid="EXO 8:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:11"/>And the frogs shall be taken away from you and out of your houses and out of your villages and from your attendants and from your people-- only in the river shall they remain."<verse eid="EXO 8:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:12"/>Then Moyses and Aaron went out from Pharao, and Moyses cried to the Lord about the curtailing of the frogs, as he had arranged with Pharao.<verse eid="EXO 8:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:13"/>And the Lord did just as Moyses said, and the frogs died from the houses and from the villages and from the fields.<verse eid="EXO 8:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:14"/>And they gathered them in heaps and heaps, and the land stank.<verse eid="EXO 8:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:15"/>But when Pharao saw that respite had occurred, his heart was weighed down, and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord said.<verse eid="EXO 8:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:16"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Say to Aaron: 'Stretch out by hand your rod, and strike the levees of earth, and there shall be gnats both on people and on quadrupeds and on the whole land of Egypt.' "<verse eid="EXO 8:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:17"/>Aaron, therefore, stretched out by hand the rod and struck the levees of the earth, and the gnats were both on people and on quadrupeds, and in every levee of the earth, the gnats were in all the land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 8:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:18"/>But also the enchanters did likewise with their magical potions to produce the gnat, and they could not. And the gnats were both on people and on quadrupeds.<verse eid="EXO 8:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:19"/>The enchanters, therefore, said to Pharao, "This is the finger of God!" And Pharao's heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord said.<verse eid="EXO 8:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:20"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharao. Look, he himself will go out to the water, and you will say to him, 'This is what the Lord says: Send away my people so that they may serve me.<verse eid="EXO 8:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:21"/>But if you should be unwilling to send away my people, look, I am going to send against you and against your attendants and against your people and against your houses the dog-fly, and the Egyptians' houses shall be filled with the dog-fly, even into the land which they are on.<verse eid="EXO 8:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:22"/>And I will distinguish gloriously on that day the land of Gesem, which my people are on, whereon the dog-fly shall not be, so that you may know that I am the Lord, the Lord of all the land<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">8:22</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'earth'</char></note>.<verse eid="EXO 8:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:23"/>And I will put a distinction between my people and between your people. Now on the morrow this sign shall be upon the land.' "<verse eid="EXO 8:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:24"/>And the Lord did so, and the dog-fly came in great numbers into the houses of Pharao and into the houses of his attendants and into the whole land of Egypt, and the land was ruined as a result of the dog-fly.<verse eid="EXO 8:24"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:25"/>Then Pharao summoned Moyses and Aaron, saying, "Go, and sacrifice to your God in the land!"<verse eid="EXO 8:25"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:26"/>And Moyses said, "It cannot be so! For we would sacrifice to the Lord our God the abominations of the Egyptians. For if we should sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians before them, we will be stoned.<verse eid="EXO 8:26"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:27"/>A three days' journey we will go into the wilderness, and we will sacrifice to the Lord, our God, according as he told us."<verse eid="EXO 8:27"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:28"/>And Pharao said, "I will send you away-- and sacrifice to the Lord, your God, in the wilderness, but not far shall you proceed to go. Pray, therefore, for me to the Lord."<verse eid="EXO 8:28"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:29"/>Then Moyses said, "Right now I will go out from you, and I will pray to God, and the dog-fly will depart from you and from your attendants and your people tomorrow. Do not add anymore, Pharao, to deceiving, so as not to send away the people to sacrifice to the Lord."<verse eid="EXO 8:29"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:30"/>Then Moyses went out from Pharao and prayed to God.<verse eid="EXO 8:30"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:31"/>Now the Lord did as Moyses said, and he took away the dog-fly from Pharao and from his attendants and from his people, and not one remained.<verse eid="EXO 8:31"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 8:32"/>And Pharao made his heart heavy also on this occasion, and he was unwilling to send away the people.<verse eid="EXO 8:32"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:1"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Go in to Pharao, and you shall say to him, 'This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says: Send away my people so that they may serve me.<verse eid="EXO 9:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:2"/>Yet if you are unwilling to send away my people, but still hold on to them,<verse eid="EXO 9:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:3"/>look, the hand of the Lord will be on your animals on the plains, both on the horses and on the draft animals and on the camels and cattle and sheep-- a very great death.<verse eid="EXO 9:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:4"/>And I will distinguish gloriously between the animals of the Egyptians and between the animals of the sons of Israel. Not a thing from all the sons of Israel shall die.' "<verse eid="EXO 9:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:5"/>And God gave a limit, saying, "Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing on the land."<verse eid="EXO 9:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:6"/>And the Lord did this thing on the next day, and all the Egyptians' animals died, but from the animals of the sons of Israel nothing died.<verse eid="EXO 9:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:7"/>But when Pharao saw that nothing from the animals of the sons of Israel died, Pharao's heart became heavy, and he did not send away the people.<verse eid="EXO 9:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:8"/>Then the Lord spoke to Moyses and Aaron, saying, "You take handfuls of furnace soot, and let Moyses scatter it toward heaven before Pharao and before his attendants.<verse eid="EXO 9:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:9"/>And let it become a dust cloud over all the land of Egypt, and there shall be upon humans and quadrupeds festering sores, oozing blisters, both on humans and on quadrupeds and in all the land of Egypt."<verse eid="EXO 9:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:10"/>And he took the furnace soot before Pharao, and Moyses scattered it toward heaven, and festering sores, oozing blisters occurred both on humans and on quadrupeds.<verse eid="EXO 9:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:11"/>And the magicians were unable to stand before Moyses because of the festering sores. For the festering sores occurred on the magicians and in the whole land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 9:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:12"/>But the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he did not listen to them, according as the Lord instructed Moyses.<verse eid="EXO 9:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:13"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharao, and you shall say to him, 'This is what the Lord says, the God of the Hebrews: Send away my people so that they may serve me.<verse eid="EXO 9:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:14"/>For at the present time I am sending out all my encounters into the heart of you and your attendants and your people so that you may know that there is no other like me in all the land<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'earth'</char></note>.<verse eid="EXO 9:14"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 9:17"/>Still then you hold on to my people so as not to send them away.<verse eid="EXO 9:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:18"/>Look, I am about to rain at this hour tomorrow very abundant hail, such as has not occurred in Egypt from the day which it was founded until this day.<verse eid="EXO 9:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:19"/>Now, therefore, hurry to gather your animals and whatever belongs to you on the plain. For all the humans and animals, whatever should be found on the plains and should not enter into a dwelling, but the hail should fall upon them, shall die.' "<verse eid="EXO 9:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:20"/>The one among Pharao's attendants who feared the word of the Lord gathered his animals into dwellings.<verse eid="EXO 9:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:21"/>But whoever did not pay attention with his mind to the word of the Lord left the animals on the plain.<verse eid="EXO 9:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:22"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven, and there shall be hail on the whole land of Egypt, both on humans and animals and on all herbage which is on the land."<verse eid="EXO 9:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:23"/>Then Moyses stretched out the hand towards heaven, and the Lord gave sounds and hail, and fire ran about on the land, and the Lord rained hail on the whole land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 9:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:24"/>Now there was hail and fire flashing in the hail. Now the hail was very, very abundant, such as had not occurred in Egypt from the time when a people had come into being upon it.<verse eid="EXO 9:24"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:25"/>Then hail struck in all the land of Egypt from human to animal, and all herbage on the plain the hail struck, and all the trees on the plains the hail crushed.<verse eid="EXO 9:25"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:26"/>Only in the land, Gesem, where the sons of Israel were, the hail did not occur.<verse eid="EXO 9:26"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:27"/>Then Pharao sent and summoned Moyses and Aaron and said to them, "Now I have sinned. The Lord is just but I and my people are impious.<verse eid="EXO 9:27"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:28"/>Therefore pray for me to the Lord, and let him put a stop to God's sounds and hail and fire, and I will send you away, and you will no longer continue to stay."<verse eid="EXO 9:28"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:29"/>And Moyses said to him, "As soon as I leave the city, I will spread out my hands to the Lord, and the sounds will stop, and the hail and the rain will be no more so that you may know that the land<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:29</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'earth'</char></note> is the Lord's.<verse eid="EXO 9:29"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:30"/>Both you and your attendants -- I know that you have not yet come to fear the Lord."<verse eid="EXO 9:30"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:31"/>Now the flax and the barley were ruined. For the barley was ripe, and the flax was going to seed.<verse eid="EXO 9:31"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:32"/>But the wheat and the spelt were not ruined, for they were late.<verse eid="EXO 9:32"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:33"/>Then Moyses went out from Pharao outside of the city, and he spread out hands to the Lord, and the sounds ceased, and the hail, and the rain no longer dripped on the land.<verse eid="EXO 9:33"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:34"/>Now when Pharao saw that the rain had ceased, and the hail and the sounds, he continued to sin and made his heart and that of his attendants heavy.<verse eid="EXO 9:34"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 9:35"/>And the heart of Pharao was hardened, and he did not send away the sons of Israel, according as the Lord said to Moyses.<verse eid="EXO 9:35"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:1"/>Then the Lord spoke to Moyses, saying, "Go in to Pharao. For I made his heart and that of his attendants heavy in order that one after another these signs might come upon them,<verse eid="EXO 10:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:2"/>that you may recount in the ears of your children and to the children of your children how I mocked the Egyptians, and my signs that I did among them, and you will know that I am Lord."<verse eid="EXO 10:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:3"/>Then Moyses and Aaron went in before Pharao and said to him, "This is what the Lord, the God of the Hebrews, says, 'For how long are you unwilling to respect me? Send away my people so that they may serve me!<verse eid="EXO 10:3"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 10:6"/>And your houses and the houses of your attendants and all the houses in all the land of Egypt shall be filled, something that your fathers or their grandfathers have never seen, from the day when they came on the land<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">10:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'earth'</char></note> until this day.' "And Moyses turned away and went out from Pharao.<verse eid="EXO 10:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:7"/>Then the attendants of Pharao say to him, "For how long will this be a stumbling-block for us? Send away the people so that they may serve the Lord their God. Or do you wish to know that Egypt lies in ruins?"<verse eid="EXO 10:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:8"/>And they brought back both Moyses and Aaron to Pharao, and he said to them, "Go! Serve the Lord your God. But who and who are those that are going?"<verse eid="EXO 10:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:9"/>And Moyses says, "With the young and old men we will go, with our sons and daughters and sheep and cattle, for it is the Lord our God's feast."<verse eid="EXO 10:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:10"/>And he said to them, "Let the Lord so be with you. According as I send you, I should not also send your chattels, should I? Take note that wickedness lies before you.<verse eid="EXO 10:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:11"/>Not so! But let the men go, and you serve God! For this you yourselves are asking." Then they thrust them out from the presence of Pharao.<verse eid="EXO 10:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:12"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Stretch out the hand on the land of Egypt, and let the grasshopper come up on the land, and it will devour all the herbage of the land and all the fruit of the trees, which the hail left behind."<verse eid="EXO 10:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:13"/>And Moyses lifted up the rod towards heaven, and the Lord brought up a south wind upon the land that whole day and whole night. The morning came, and the south wind took up the grasshopper<verse eid="EXO 10:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:14"/>and brought it up on all the land of Egypt, and a great many settled on all the borders of Egypt. A grasshopper such as this had not occurred before it, and after it there shall not be such.<verse eid="EXO 10:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:15"/>And it covered the face of the land, and the land was ruined. And it devoured all the herbage of the land and all the fruit of the trees, which was left from the hail. Nothing green was left on the trees and on all the herbage of the plain in the whole land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 10:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:16"/>Then Pharao hastened to summon Moyses and Aaron, saying, "I have sinned before the Lord your God and against you.<verse eid="EXO 10:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:17"/>Therefore bear with my sin now again, and pray to the Lord your God, and let him take away from me this death."<verse eid="EXO 10:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:18"/>So Moyses went out from Pharao and prayed to God.<verse eid="EXO 10:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:19"/>And the Lord turned a violent wind from the sea, and it took up the grasshopper and threw it into the Red Sea, and not one grasshopper was left in the whole land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 10:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:20"/>And the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he did not send away the sons of Israel.<verse eid="EXO 10:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:21"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Stretch out the hand towards heaven, and let there be darkness over the land of Egypt, palpable darkness."<verse eid="EXO 10:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:22"/>So Moyses stretched out the hand toward heaven, and there was darkness, gloom, hurricane, on all the land of Egypt for three days.<verse eid="EXO 10:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:23"/>And no one saw his brother, and no one rose up from his bed for three days. But for all the sons of Israel there was light in all places where they were dwelling.<verse eid="EXO 10:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:24"/>And Pharao summoned Moyses and Aaron, saying, "Go! Serve the Lord your God. Only leave behind the sheep and cattle. And let your chattels depart with you."<verse eid="EXO 10:24"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:25"/>And Moyses said, "But you also will give us whole burnt offerings and sacrifices that we shall make to the Lord our God,<verse eid="EXO 10:25"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:26"/>and our animals will go with us, and we shall not leave behind a hoof. For from them we shall take to serve the Lord our God. But we do not know how we should worship the Lord our God until we go there."<verse eid="EXO 10:26"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:27"/>But the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he was unwilling to send them away.<verse eid="EXO 10:27"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:28"/>And Pharao says, "Depart from me; watch out that yet again you see my face. Now on whatever day you should appear to me, you shall die!"<verse eid="EXO 10:28"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 10:29"/>Then Moyses says, "You have spoken! I shall no longer appear to you in person."<verse eid="EXO 10:29"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 11:1"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Still one plague I will bring upon Pharao and upon Egypt, and after these things he will send you away from here. Now whenever he sends you away, with everything he will expel you with expulsion.<verse eid="EXO 11:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 11:2"/>Speak then secretly to the ears of the people, and let each one ask from his neighbor and a woman from her neighbor silver and gold articles and clothing."<verse eid="EXO 11:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 11:3"/>Now the Lord gave favor to his people before the Egyptians, and they supplied them. And the man Moyses became very great before the Egyptians and before Pharao and before all his attendants.<verse eid="EXO 11:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 11:4"/>And Moyses said, "This is what the Lord says: Around midnight I am going to enter into the midst of Egypt,<verse eid="EXO 11:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 11:5"/>and every firstborn in the land, Egypt, shall die, from the firstborn of Pharao, who sits on the throne, to the firstborn of the female slave by the millstone and to the firstborn of every animal.<verse eid="EXO 11:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 11:6"/>And there will be a great cry throughout the whole land of Egypt, such as has not been and such as will not again be repeated.<verse eid="EXO 11:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 11:7"/>But among all the sons of Israel a dog will not snarl with his tongue from human being to animal in order that you might know by what means the Lord shall distinguish gloriously between the Egyptians and Israel.<verse eid="EXO 11:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 11:8"/>And all these servants of yours shall come down to me and do obeisance before me, saying, 'Leave, you and all your people, whom you are leading away,' and after these things I will go out." Then Moyses went out from Pharao with wrath.<verse eid="EXO 11:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 11:9"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Pharao will not listen to you in order that I may multiply my signs and wonders in the land, Egypt."<verse eid="EXO 11:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 11:10"/>So Moyses and Aaron did all these signs and wonders in the land, Egypt, before Pharao. But the Lord hardened Pharao's heart, and he was unwilling to send away the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 11:10"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:1"/>Then the Lord spoke to Moyses and Aaron in the land, Egypt, saying:<verse eid="EXO 12:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:2"/>This month shall be for you the beginning of months; it is first for you among the months of the year.<verse eid="EXO 12:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:3"/>Speak to the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, "On the tenth of this month let them take, each person, a sheep according to the paternal houses, a sheep for each household.<verse eid="EXO 12:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:4"/>But if those in the household are too few so that they are not enough for a sheep, he shall join with himself his nearby neighbor according to the number of souls; you, each one, shall number together that which is sufficient for a sheep.<verse eid="EXO 12:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:5"/>You shall have a perfect sheep, a one-year-old male. You shall take from the lambs and kids.<verse eid="EXO 12:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:6"/>And it shall be kept for you until the fourteenth of this month, and all the multitude of the congregation of the sons of Israel shall slay it towards evening.<verse eid="EXO 12:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:7"/>And they shall take some of the blood and shall put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel in the houses whichever they eat them in.<verse eid="EXO 12:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:8"/>And they shall eat the meat this night, roasted in fire, and they shall eat unleavened bread with bitter herbs.<verse eid="EXO 12:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:9"/>You shall not eat from it raw or boiled in water but rather roasted in fire, head with the feet and inner organs.<verse eid="EXO 12:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:10"/>You shall not leave any of it until morning, and you shall not break a bone of it. But that which remains from it until morning, you shall burn with fire.<verse eid="EXO 12:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:11"/>Now in this way you shall eat it: your loins girded and your sandals on your feet and your staves in your hands. And you shall eat it with haste-- it is the Lord's pascha.<verse eid="EXO 12:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:12"/>And I will pass through in the land, Egypt, on this night, and I will strike down every firstborn in the land, Egypt, from human being to animal, and on all the gods of the Egyptians I will execute vengeance. I am the Lord.<verse eid="EXO 12:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:13"/>And the blood shall be for you as a sign on the houses, there where you are, and I will see the blood, and I will protect you, and there shall not be a plague among you to destroy, whenever I strike in the land, Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 12:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:14"/>And this day shall be a memorial for you, and you shall celebrate it as a feast to the Lord throughout your generations. You shall celebrate it as a perpetual precept.<verse eid="EXO 12:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:15"/>For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but from the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses. Everyone, whoever eats leaven, that soul shall be destroyed from Israel, from the first day until the seventh day.<verse eid="EXO 12:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:16"/>And the first day shall be called holy, and the seventh day shall be designated holy for you. No work of service shall be done on them, except what shall be done for every soul; this only shall be done for you.<verse eid="EXO 12:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:17"/>And you shall keep this commandment. For on this day I will bring your host out of the land of Egypt, and you shall make this day throughout your generations a perpetual precept.<verse eid="EXO 12:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:18"/>When the first month begins, on the fourteenth day, from the evening you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month until the evening.<verse eid="EXO 12:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:19"/>For seven days leaven shall not be found in your houses. Everyone, whoever eats something leavened, that soul shall be destroyed from the congregation of Israel both among the gioras<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">12:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Aramaic/Hebrew = 'resident alien'</char></note> and the natives of the land.<verse eid="EXO 12:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:20"/>Anything leavened you shall not eat; in every habitation of yours you shall eat unleavened bread."<verse eid="EXO 12:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:21"/>Then Moyses summoned the entire elders' council of Israel and said to them, "When you go away, take for yourselves a sheep according to your families and sacrifice the pascha.<verse eid="EXO 12:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:22"/>And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dipping from the blood by the door, you shall also touch the lintel and on both doorposts, from the blood that is by the door. But you, each one, shall not go out the door of his house until morning.<verse eid="EXO 12:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:23"/>And the Lord will pass by to strike the Egyptians, and he will see the blood upon the lintel and on both doorposts, and the Lord will pass by the door, and he will not allow the destroyer to enter into your houses to strike.<verse eid="EXO 12:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:24"/>And you shall keep this word as a precept for yourself and your sons forever.<verse eid="EXO 12:24"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:25"/>Now when you come into the land whichever the Lord gives you, according as he said, you shall observe this service.<verse eid="EXO 12:25"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:26"/>And it shall be if your sons shall say to you, 'What is this service?'<verse eid="EXO 12:26"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:27"/>then you shall say to them, 'This pascha is a sacrifice to the Lord who protected the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt when he struck the Egyptians, but our houses he preserved.' "And the people bent down and did obeisance.<verse eid="EXO 12:27"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:28"/>And when they went away, the sons of Israel did as the Lord commanded Moyses and Aaron; so they did.<verse eid="EXO 12:28"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:29"/>Now it happened during the middle of the night that the Lord struck every firstborn in the land, Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharao who sits upon the throne, to the firstborn of the female captive who is in the pit, even to the firstborn of every animal.<verse eid="EXO 12:29"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:30"/>And Pharao arose during the night and all his attendants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry in all the land of Egypt. For there was not a house which had no dead person in it.<verse eid="EXO 12:30"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:31"/>And Pharao summoned Moyses and Aaron during the night and he said to them, "Arise, and go out from my people, both you and the sons of Israel. Go! Serve the Lord your God according as you say.<verse eid="EXO 12:31"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:32"/>Take both your sheep and cattle, and get going, but bless me too."<verse eid="EXO 12:32"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:33"/>And the Egyptians were forcing the people, to throw them out of the land quickly. For they said, "We are all dying!"<verse eid="EXO 12:33"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:34"/>Now the people took the dough before it was leavened, their kneaded mixtures wrapped in their clothes on their shoulders.<verse eid="EXO 12:34"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:35"/>And the sons of Israel did as Moyses instructed them and asked from the Egyptians silver and gold articles and clothing.<verse eid="EXO 12:35"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:36"/>And the Lord gave favor to his people before the Egyptians, and they supplied them, and they plundered the Egyptians.<verse eid="EXO 12:36"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:37"/>Now the sons of Israel marched from Ramesses to Sokchotha; the men were about six hundred thousand foot soldiers, apart from the chattels.<verse eid="EXO 12:37"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:38"/>And a great, mixed crowd went up with them, and sheep and oxen, even a great many animals.<verse eid="EXO 12:38"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:39"/>And they baked the dough that they brought from Egypt, unleavened bread baked in ashes, for it was not leavened. For the Egyptians had thrown them out, and they were unable to remain, nor did they make provision for themselves for the journey.<verse eid="EXO 12:39"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:40"/>Now the residence of the sons of Israel during which they dwelt in the land, Egypt, and in the land of Chanaan was four hundred and thirty years.<verse eid="EXO 12:40"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:41"/>And it happened after four hundred and thirty years that all the host of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt during the night.<verse eid="EXO 12:41"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:42"/>It is a vigil for the Lord so that he might bring them out of the land of Egypt. That night is this vigil for the Lord so that it might be for all the sons of Israel throughout their generations.<verse eid="EXO 12:42"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:43"/>Then the Lord spoke to Moyses and Aaron, saying: This is the law of the pascha. No alien shall eat of it.<verse eid="EXO 12:43"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:44"/>And every domestic of anyone or purchased slave you shall circumcise him, and then he shall eat of it.<verse eid="EXO 12:44"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:45"/>A resident alien or hired person shall not eat of it.<verse eid="EXO 12:45"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:46"/>In one house it shall be eaten; you shall not take any of the meat outside of the house, and you shall not break a bone of it.<verse eid="EXO 12:46"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:47"/>The entire congregation of the sons of Israel shall do this.<verse eid="EXO 12:47"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:48"/>But if any guest should draw near to you to keep the pascha to the Lord, you shall circumcise every male of his, and then he shall draw near to keep it, and he shall be like a native of the land. No uncircumcised person shall eat of it.<verse eid="EXO 12:48"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:49"/>There shall be one law for the local inhabitant and for the guest among you who has drawn near.<verse eid="EXO 12:49"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:50"/>And the sons of Israel did just as the Lord commanded Moyses and Aaron for them; so they did.<verse eid="EXO 12:50"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 12:51"/>And it happened on that day the Lord brought the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt together with their host.<verse eid="EXO 12:51"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:1"/>Then the Lord spoke to Moyses, saying:<verse eid="EXO 13:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:2"/>Consecrate to me every firstborn, first-produced, opening every womb among the sons of Israel, from human being to animal. It's mine!<verse eid="EXO 13:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:3"/>Then Moyses said to the people, "Keep remembering this day in which you came out of Egypt, from a house of slavery. For by a mighty hand the Lord brought you out from there. And leaven shall not be eaten.<verse eid="EXO 13:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:4"/>For on this very day you are going out in the month of the new things.<verse eid="EXO 13:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:5"/>And it shall be whenever the Lord your God brings you into the land of the Chananites and Chettites and Heuites and Gergesites and Amorrites and Pherezites and Iebousites, which he swore to your fathers to give you, a land flowing with milk and honey, you shall also perform this service in this month.<verse eid="EXO 13:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:6"/>For six days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the seventh day there is the Lord's feast.<verse eid="EXO 13:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:7"/>Unleavened bread you shall eat for the seven days. Anything leavened shall not be seen among you, nor shall you possess leaven in all your borders.<verse eid="EXO 13:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:8"/>And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, 'For this reason the Lord God acted for me when I was going out of Egypt.'<verse eid="EXO 13:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:9"/>And it shall be a sign for you on your hand and a memorial before your eyes in order that the law of the Lord might be in your mouth. For with a mighty hand the Lord brought you out of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 13:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:10"/>And you shall keep this law according to the times of the seasons from days to days.<verse eid="EXO 13:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:11"/>"And it shall be whenever the Lord your God brings you into the land of the Chananites, in the manner which he swore to your fathers, and he gives it to you,<verse eid="EXO 13:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:12"/>you shall also set apart everything opening the womb, the males, for the Lord. Everything opening the womb from the herds or among your animals, whatever belongs to you, you shall consecrate the males to the Lord.<verse eid="EXO 13:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:13"/>Everything opening the womb of a donkey you will exchange for a sheep. But if you do not make an exchange, you shall redeem it. Every firstborn of a human being among your sons you shall redeem.<verse eid="EXO 13:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:14"/>Now if your son should ask you afterward, saying, 'What is this?' you shall also say to him, 'With a mighty hand the Lord brought us out of the land of Egypt, from a house of slavery.<verse eid="EXO 13:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:15"/>But when Pharao hardened against sending us away, he killed every firstborn in the land, Egypt, from the firstborn of human beings to the firstborn of animals.

    <verse sid="EXO 13:16"/>And it shall be for a sign on your hand and immovable before your eyes. For with a mighty hand the Lord brought you out of Egypt."<verse eid="EXO 13:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:17"/>Now when Pharao sent away the people, God did not lead them the way of the land of the Phylistiim, because it was near. For God said, "Lest there be regret by the people when they see war and they return to Egypt."<verse eid="EXO 13:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:18"/>And God led the people a roundabout way towards the wilderness, towards the Red Sea. Now in the fifth generation the sons of Israel went up out of the land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 13:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:19"/>And Moyses took the bones of Ioseph with him. For Ioseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath, saying, "With a concern the Lord will concern himself with you, and you shall bring my bones there with you."<verse eid="EXO 13:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 13:20"/>Then the sons of Israel, when they departed from Sokchoth, camped at Othom on the edge of the wilderness.<verse eid="EXO 13:20"/>

  <chapter sid="EXO 14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:1"/>And the Lord spoke to Moyses, saying:<verse eid="EXO 14:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:2"/>Speak to the sons of Israel, and when they turn back, let them camp opposite the village between Magdolos and between the sea, opposite Beelsepphon. Before them you shall camp by the sea.<verse eid="EXO 14:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:3"/>And Pharao will say to his people, "These sons of Israel are wandering in the land. For the wilderness has closed in on them."<verse eid="EXO 14:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:4"/>Now I will harden Pharao's heart, and he will pursue after them. And I will be glorified in Pharao and in all his army, and all the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord. And they did so.<verse eid="EXO 14:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:5"/>And it was reported to the king of the Egyptians that the people had escaped. And the heart of Pharao and his attendants was turned against the people, and they said, "What is this we have done, sending away the sons of Israel so they are not subject to us?"<verse eid="EXO 14:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:6"/>Then Pharao hitched up his chariots and led away all his people together with him,<verse eid="EXO 14:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:7"/>and he took six hundred choice chariots and all the cavalry of the Egyptians and the third-ranked officers over all of them.<verse eid="EXO 14:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:8"/>And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, king of Egypt, and he pursued after the sons of Israel. Now the sons of Israel were leaving with a high hand.<verse eid="EXO 14:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:9"/>And the Egyptians pursued after them and found them encamped by the sea, and all the cavalry and chariots of Pharao and the horsemen and his army were opposite the village, opposite Beelsepphon.<verse eid="EXO 14:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:10"/>And Pharao advanced. And when they looked up, the sons of Israel saw with their eyes, and the Egyptians encamped behind them, and they were very afraid. Then the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord.<verse eid="EXO 14:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:11"/>And they said to Moyses, "Because there were not graves in the land of Egypt did you bring us out to put us to death in this wilderness? What is this you have done to us, bringing us out of Egypt?<verse eid="EXO 14:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:12"/>Was this not the matter that we told you in Egypt, saying, 'Leave us alone in order that we might be subject to the Egyptians?' For it was better for us to be subject to the Egyptians than to die in this wilderness."<verse eid="EXO 14:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:13"/>But Moyses said to the people, "Take courage! Stand, and see the deliverance from God that he will perform for you today. For as you have seen the Egyptians today, you shall not ever again see them time without end.<verse eid="EXO 14:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:14"/>The Lord will fight for you, and you will be quiet."<verse eid="EXO 14:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:15"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Why are you crying out to me? Speak to the sons of Israel, and let them break camp.<verse eid="EXO 14:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:16"/>And you, raise your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea, and break it apart, and let the sons of Israel enter into the midst of the sea on what was dry.<verse eid="EXO 14:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:17"/>And look, I will harden the heart of Pharao and all the Egyptians, and they will enter in after them. And I will be glorified in Pharao and in all his army and in his chariots and in his horses.<verse eid="EXO 14:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:18"/>And all the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, as I am being glorified in Pharao and in his chariots and his horses."<verse eid="EXO 14:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:19"/>Then the angel of God, who was going before the camp of the sons of Israel, rose up and went behind. Now the pillar of cloud also rose up from before them and stood behind them.<verse eid="EXO 14:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:20"/>And it went in between the camp of the Egyptians and between the camp of Israel. And there was darkness and gloom, and the night elapsed, and they did not mix together with one another during the whole night.<verse eid="EXO 14:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:21"/>But Moyses stretched out the hand over the sea, and the Lord drew off the sea by a strong south wind during the whole night, and he made the sea dry, and the water was divided.<verse eid="EXO 14:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:22"/>And the sons of Israel entered into the midst of the sea on the dry ground, and the water became a wall for them on the right and a wall on the left.<verse eid="EXO 14:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:23"/>Then the Egyptians pursued, and all the cavalry of Pharao and the chariots and the riders went in after them into the midst of the sea.<verse eid="EXO 14:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:24"/>And it happened in the early morning watch that the Lord looked at the camp of the Egyptians in the pillar of fire and cloud, and he threw the camp of the Egyptians into disarray.<verse eid="EXO 14:24"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:25"/>And he bound together the axles of their chariots and led them violently. And the Egyptians said, "Let us flee from Israel! For the Lord fights the Egyptians for them!"<verse eid="EXO 14:25"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:26"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea, and let the water return and cover up the Egyptians, both the chariots and the riders."<verse eid="EXO 14:26"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:27"/>So Moyses stretched out the hand over the sea, and the water returned near day to its place. Now the Egyptians fled under the water, and the Lord shook off the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.<verse eid="EXO 14:27"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:28"/>And when the water had returned, it covered the chariots and riders and all the host of Pharao that had entered after them into the sea. Not even one of them remained!<verse eid="EXO 14:28"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:29"/>But the sons of Israel went across dry ground in the midst of the sea, and the water was for them a wall on the right and a wall on the left.<verse eid="EXO 14:29"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:30"/>And the Lord rescued Israel in that day from the hand of the Egyptians. And Israel saw the Egyptians dead along the shore of the sea.<verse eid="EXO 14:30"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 14:31"/>So Israel saw the great hand, which things the Lord had done to the Egyptians. And the people feared the Lord and trusted God and Moyses, his attendant.<verse eid="EXO 14:31"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 15:1"/>Then Moyses and the sons of Israel sang this song to God and spoke, saying, "Let us sing to the Lord, for gloriously he has glorified himself; horse and rider he threw into the sea.<verse eid="EXO 15:1"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 15:22"/>Then Moyses removed the sons of Israel from the Red Sea and led them into the wilderness of Sour. And they were journeying for three days in the wilderness and were not finding water to drink.<verse eid="EXO 15:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 15:23"/>And they came to Merra and could not drink water from Merra, for it was bitter. Therefore the name of that place was called Bitterness.<verse eid="EXO 15:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 15:24"/>And the people were complaining against Moyses, saying, "What shall we drink?"<verse eid="EXO 15:24"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 15:27"/>And they came to Ailim, and twelve springs of water and seventy date palm trunks were there. And they camped there by the waters.<verse eid="EXO 15:27"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:1"/>And they set out from Ailim, and the entire congregation of the sons of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Ailim and between Sina. And on the fifteenth day, in the second month, after they had gone out from the land of Egypt,<verse eid="EXO 16:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:2"/>the entire congregation of the sons of Israel was complaining against Moyses and Aaron,<verse eid="EXO 16:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:3"/>and the sons of Israel said to them, "If only we had died, struck by the Lord, in the land, Egypt, when we sat at the cauldrons of meat and were eating bread to the full, because you led us out into this wilderness to kill all this congregation by famine."<verse eid="EXO 16:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:4"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Look, I am going to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out, and they shall collect the day's portion for a day so that I might test them whether they will walk by my law or not.<verse eid="EXO 16:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:5"/>And it shall be on the sixth day, and they shall prepare whatever they bring in, and it shall be double whatever they gather together daily for a day."<verse eid="EXO 16:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:6"/>Then Moyses and Aaron said to the entire congregation of the sons of Israel, "At evening you shall know that the Lord brought you out of the land of Egypt,<verse eid="EXO 16:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:7"/>and in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord, when he heard your complaining against God. But we, what are we that you complain against us?"<verse eid="EXO 16:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:8"/>And Moyses said, "When the Lord gives you meat in the evening to eat and bread in the morning to the full, because the Lord heard your complaining which you complain against us, then we, what are we? For not against us is your complaining, but rather against God."<verse eid="EXO 16:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:9"/>And Moyses said to Aaron, "Say to the entire congregation of the sons of Israel: Draw near before God. For he has heard your complaining."<verse eid="EXO 16:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:10"/>And when Aaron was speaking to the entire congregation of the sons of Israel, they also turned about towards the wilderness, and the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.<verse eid="EXO 16:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:11"/>And the Lord spoke to Moyses, saying,<verse eid="EXO 16:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:12"/>"I have heard the complaining of the sons of Israel. Speak to them, saying: Towards evening you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. And you shall know that I am the Lord, your God."<verse eid="EXO 16:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:13"/>So evening came, and quail<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'a quail-like migrating bird'</char></note> came up and covered the camp. Then morning came, when the dew was lifting around the camp,<verse eid="EXO 16:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:14"/>and look, upon the surface of the wilderness was something fine like coriander, white like frost on the ground.<verse eid="EXO 16:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:15"/>And when they saw it, the sons of Israel said one to the other, "What is this?" For they did not know what it was. Then Moyses said to them, "This is the bread that the Lord has given you to eat.<verse eid="EXO 16:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:16"/>This is the word that the Lord instructed, 'Each person, gather from it for those appropriate; a gomor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:16</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 omer = 2 liters; Hebrew 1 homer = 220 liters</char></note> per head, according to the number of your souls, each of you with your tent mates collect.' "<verse eid="EXO 16:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:17"/>And the sons of Israel did so, and they collected, the one much and the other less.<verse eid="EXO 16:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:18"/>And they measured by the gomor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:18</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 omer = 2 liters; Hebrew 1 homer = 220 liters</char></note>. The one with much did not have excess, and the one with less did not have too little. Each person collected for those appropriate at his own home.<verse eid="EXO 16:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:19"/>Then Moyses said to them, "Let no one leave any of it to the morning."<verse eid="EXO 16:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:20"/>And they did not listen to Moyses, but certain ones left some of it to the morning. And it bred worms and stank, and Moyses was irritated with them.<verse eid="EXO 16:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:21"/>And they collected it morning by morning, each person that which was appropriate for him. But when the sun grew hot, it melted.<verse eid="EXO 16:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:22"/>But it happened on the sixth day, they collected double what was required, two gomors<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:22</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 omer = 2 liters; Hebrew 1 homer = 220 liters</char></note> for one person. And all the leaders of the congregation went in and reported to Moyses.<verse eid="EXO 16:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:23"/>And Moyses said to them, "This is the word that the Lord spoke: Tomorrow is Sabbata, a rest holy to the Lord. Whatever you bake, bake, and whatever you boil, boil. And all the excess, leave it in storage until the morning."<verse eid="EXO 16:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:24"/>And they left some of it until the morning, according as Moyses instructed them. And it did not stink, nor was there a worm in it.<verse eid="EXO 16:24"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:25"/>And Moyses said, "Eat today! For today is Sabbata to the Lord. It will not be found on the plain.<verse eid="EXO 16:25"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:26"/>Six days you will collect, but on the seventh day is Sabbata. There will be none in it."<verse eid="EXO 16:26"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:27"/>And it happened on the seventh day, certain of the people went out to collect, and they found none.<verse eid="EXO 16:27"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:28"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "For how long are you unwilling to listen to my commandments and my law?<verse eid="EXO 16:28"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:29"/>See! For the Lord has given you this day, the sabbaths. Therefore he gave you on the sixth day bread for two days. Sit, each person, in your houses; let no one go out from his place on the seventh day."<verse eid="EXO 16:29"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:30"/>And the people sab-batized on the seventh day.<verse eid="EXO 16:30"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:31"/>And the sons of Israel called its name Man. Now it was white like coriander seed, but its taste was like cake with honey.<verse eid="EXO 16:31"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:32"/>Then Moyses said, "This is the word that the Lord instructed: Fill the gomor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:32</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 omer = 2 liters; Hebrew 1 homer = 220 liters</char></note> with Man for deposit for your generations in order that they might see the bread that you ate in the wilderness, how the Lord brought you out from the land of Egypt."<verse eid="EXO 16:32"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:33"/>And Moyses said to Aaron, "Take one golden jar, and place in it the gomor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:33</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 omer = 2 liters; Hebrew 1 homer = 220 liters</char></note> full of Man, and you will put it away before God for preservation for your generations."<verse eid="EXO 16:33"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:34"/>As the Lord instructed Moyses, Aaron also put it away before the witness for preservation.<verse eid="EXO 16:34"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:35"/>Now the sons of Israel ate Man for forty years until they came into inhabited land. They ate Man until they came near to the region of Phoenicia.<verse eid="EXO 16:35"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 16:36"/>Now the gomor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:36</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 omer = 2 liters; Hebrew 1 homer = 220 liters</char></note> was a tenth of three measures.<verse eid="EXO 16:36"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:1"/>And the entire congregation of the sons of Israel set out from the wilderness of Sin according to their encampments by the word of the Lord, and they camped at Raphidin. But there was not water for the people to drink.<verse eid="EXO 17:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:2"/>And the people were railing against Moyses, saying, "Give us water so that we may drink!" And Moyses said to them, "Why are you railing at me, and why are you testing the Lord?"<verse eid="EXO 17:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:3"/>But the people thirsted there for water, and the people kept complaining against Moyses, saying, "Why is it that you brought us up from Egypt to kill us and our children and animals with thirst?"<verse eid="EXO 17:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:4"/>Then Moyses cried out to the Lord, saying, "What shall I do with this people? A little while yet and they will stone me!"<verse eid="EXO 17:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:5"/>And the Lord said to Moyses, "Go on ahead of this people,, but take with you some of the elders of the people and the rod with which you struck the river take in your hand, and go.<verse eid="EXO 17:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:6"/>I here have taken my stand, before you came, on the rock at Choreb. And you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, and the people will drink." And Moyses did so before the sons of Israel.<verse eid="EXO 17:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:7"/>And he called the name of that place Testing and Raillery because of the railing of the sons of Israel and because they tested the Lord, saying, "Is the Lord among us or not?"<verse eid="EXO 17:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:8"/>Then Amalek came and was fighting Israel at Raphidin.<verse eid="EXO 17:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:9"/>And Moyses said to Iesous, "Choose for yourself capable men, and go forth, and set up in battle array with Amalek tomorrow. And look, I stand on top of the hill, and the rod of God is in my hand."<verse eid="EXO 17:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:10"/>And Iesous did as Moyses said to him and set up in battle array with Amalek, and Moyses and Aaron and Hor went up onto the top of the hill.<verse eid="EXO 17:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:11"/>And it happened whenever Moyses held up his hands, Israel was prevailing, and whenever he lowered his hands, Amalek was prevailing.<verse eid="EXO 17:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:12"/>But Moyses' hands were heavy. And they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. And Aaron and Hor kept supporting his hands, here one and there one. And the hands of Moyses were supported until the setting of the sun.<verse eid="EXO 17:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:13"/>And Iesous routed Amalek and all his people by slaughter of dagger.<verse eid="EXO 17:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:14"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Write this down for a memorial in a book, and put into the ears of Iesous that with a wipe out I will wipe out the memorial of Amalek from beneath heaven.<verse eid="EXO 17:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 17:15"/>And Moyses built an altar to the Lord and called its name "The Lord is my refuge<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">17:15</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'My Lord is a refuge'</char></note>,"<verse eid="EXO 17:15"/>

  <chapter sid="EXO 18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 18:1"/>Now Iothor, the priest of Madian, Moyses' father-in-law, heard all that the Lord did to Israel, his own people. For the Lord brought Israel out from Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 18:1"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 19:14"/>And Moyses went down from the mountain to the people and consecrated them, and they washed their clothes.<verse eid="EXO 19:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 19:15"/>And he said to the people, "Prepare for three days.

    <verse sid="EXO 19:16"/>And it happened on the third day, when it was toward dawn, sounds and lightning and dark cloud were occurring upon the mountain Sina; the sound of the trumpet was ringing loudly, and all the people in the camp were terrified.<verse eid="EXO 19:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 19:17"/>And Moyses led the people out from the camp for a meeting with God, and they stood near, below the mountain.<verse eid="EXO 19:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 19:18"/>Now the mountain Sina was smoking in its entirety, because God had come down upon it in fire, and the smoke was rising up like the smoke of a furnace. And all the people were very astonished.<verse eid="EXO 19:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 19:19"/>Now the sounds of the trumpet, increasing, became much stronger. Moyses was speaking, and God answered him with sound.<verse eid="EXO 19:19"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 31:18"/>And he gave Moyses, when he stopped speaking to him on the mountain, Sina, the two tablets of witness, stone tablets written by the finger of God.<verse eid="EXO 31:18"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 32"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:1"/>And when the people saw that Moyses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered together before<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">32:1</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'against'</char></note> Aaron and say to him, "Get up, and make us gods who will go before us. For this Moyses, the man who brought us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him."<verse eid="EXO 32:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:2"/>And Aaron says to them, "Remove the gold earrings in the ears of your wives and daughters, and bring them to me."<verse eid="EXO 32:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:3"/>And all the people removed the gold earrings in their ears and brought them to Aaron.<verse eid="EXO 32:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:4"/>And he received from their hands and formed them with an engraving tool and made them a molten calf and said, "These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt."<verse eid="EXO 32:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:5"/>And when Aaron saw, he built an altar before it, and Aaron proclaimed, saying, "The Lord's feast tomorrow!"<verse eid="EXO 32:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:6"/>And early the next day, he brought up whole burnt offerings and offered a sacrifice of deliverance, and the people sat down to eat and drink, and they arose to play.<verse eid="EXO 32:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:7"/>And the Lord spoke to Moyses, saying, "Go! Descend quickly from here, for your people have acted lawlessly, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt.<verse eid="EXO 32:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:8"/>They have deviated quickly from the way that you commanded them. They made for themselves a calf and did obeisance to it and offered sacrifices to it, and they said,<verse eid="EXO 32:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:9"/>'These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.'<verse eid="EXO 32:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:10"/>And now allow me, and, enraged with anger against them, I will destroy them and make you into a great nation."<verse eid="EXO 32:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:11"/>And Moyses prayed before the Lord his God and said, "Why, Lord, are you enraged with anger against your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and an uplifted arm?<verse eid="EXO 32:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:12"/>Lest the Egyptians should speak, saying, 'With evil intent he led them out to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them utterly from the earth,' stop the anger of your rage, and be propitious at the wickedness of your people,<verse eid="EXO 32:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:13"/>remembering Abraam and Isaak and Iakob, your domestics, to whom you swore by yourself and spoke to them, saying, 'I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the sky in number,' and all this land that you said you would give to their seed, and they will possess it forever."<verse eid="EXO 32:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:14"/>And the Lord was propitiated concerning the harm that he said he would do to his people.<verse eid="EXO 32:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:15"/>And Moyses turned and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of witness were in his hands, stone tablets written on both their sides; on this side and that side they were written.<verse eid="EXO 32:15"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:16"/>And the tablets were God's work, and the writing, God's writing, was engraved in the tablets.<verse eid="EXO 32:16"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:17"/>And when Iesous heard the sound of the people shouting, he says to Moyses, "The sound of war is in the camp!"<verse eid="EXO 32:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:18"/>And he says, "It is not the sound of those taking the lead by force or the sound of those taking the lead in a rout, but the sound of those taking the lead in wine I hear."<verse eid="EXO 32:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:19"/>Now when he was drawing near to the camp, he sees the calf and the dancing, and being enraged with anger, Moyses threw from his hands the two tablets and shattered them beneath the mountain.<verse eid="EXO 32:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:20"/>And taking the calf that they made, he burnt it with fire and ground it small and scattered it on the water and made the sons of Israel drink it.<verse eid="EXO 32:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:21"/>And Moyses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you that you brought upon them great sin?"<verse eid="EXO 32:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:22"/>And Aaron said to Moyses, "Do not be enraged, lord. For you know the impulse of this people.<verse eid="EXO 32:22"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:23"/>For they say to me, 'Make us gods who will go before us. For this Moyses, the man who brought us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'<verse eid="EXO 32:23"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:24"/>And I said to them, 'If gold things belong to anyone, take them off!' and they gave them to me, and I threw them into the fire, and this calf came out!"<verse eid="EXO 32:24"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:25"/>And when Moyses saw the people, that it had scattered-- for Aaron scattered them, an object of gloating to their opponents--<verse eid="EXO 32:25"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:26"/>then Moyses stood at the gate of the camp and said, "Who is with the Lord? Let him come to me!" Then all the sons of Leui gathered to him.<verse eid="EXO 32:26"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:27"/>And he says to them, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says, 'Each one put his own sword on his thigh, and go through, and return from gate to gate through the camp, and each one kill his brother, and each one his neighbor, and each one the one nearest to him.' "<verse eid="EXO 32:27"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:28"/>And the sons of Leui did according as Moyses said to them, and there fell from the people on that day about three thousand men.<verse eid="EXO 32:28"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:29"/>And Moyses said to them, "You filled your hands today for the Lord, each one by the son or by the brother, for a blessing to be bestowed upon you."<verse eid="EXO 32:29"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:30"/>And it happened on the next day that Moyses said to the people, "You have sinned a great sin, and now I will go up to God in order that I might make atonement for your sin."<verse eid="EXO 32:30"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:31"/>Then Moyses turned to the Lord and said, "I beg, O Lord. This people has sinned a great sin and made for themselves gold gods.<verse eid="EXO 32:31"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:32"/>And now, if you shall forgive them the sin, forgive. But if not, erase me from your book that you have written."<verse eid="EXO 32:32"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:33"/>And the Lord said to Moyses, "If anyone has sinned before me, I will erase him from my book.<verse eid="EXO 32:33"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:34"/>But now go, and lead this people to the place that I told you. Look, my angel<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">32:34</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'messenger'</char></note> will go before your face. But on whichever day I concern myself, I will bring upon them their sin."<verse eid="EXO 32:34"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 32:35"/>And the Lord struck the people for the making of the calf that Aaron made.<verse eid="EXO 32:35"/>



  <chapter sid="EXO 33"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:1"/>And the Lord said to Moyses, "Go, ascend from here, you and your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt, into the land that I swore to Abraam, Isaak and Iakob, saying, 'To your seed I will give it.'<verse eid="EXO 33:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:2"/>And I will send along my angel<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">33:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'messenger'</char></note> before you, and he will cast out the Amorrite and Chettite and Pherezite and Gergesite and Heuite and Iebousite.<verse eid="EXO 33:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:3"/>And he will lead you into a land flowing with milk and honey. For I shall never go up together with you because you are a stiff-necked people, lest I exterminate you in the way."<verse eid="EXO 33:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:4"/>And when the people heard this grievous statement, they mourned in mournful ways.<verse eid="EXO 33:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:5"/>And the Lord said to the sons of Israel, "You are a stiff-necked people. Watch, lest I bring another plague upon you and exterminate you. Now then, take off the vestments of your glory and the ornamentation, and I will show you what I will do to you."<verse eid="EXO 33:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:6"/>And the sons of Israel removed their ornamentation and finery from<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">33:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'after they had left'</char></note> the mountain of Choreb.<verse eid="EXO 33:6"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:7"/>And Moyses took his tent and pitched it outside the camp, far from the camp, and it was called "tent of witness." And it happened that everyone who was seeking the Lord would go out to the tent outside the camp.<verse eid="EXO 33:7"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:8"/>And when Moyses would go into the tent, all the people stood, watching, each one at the doors of his tent, and they would pay attention as Moyses went away until he entered into the tent.<verse eid="EXO 33:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:9"/>And whenever Moyses entered into the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the doors of the tent and would speak to Moyses.<verse eid="EXO 33:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:10"/>And all the people would see the pillar of cloud standing at the doors of the tent, and all the people stood and did obeisance each one at the door of his tent.<verse eid="EXO 33:10"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:11"/>And the Lord spoke to Moyses face to face, as if someone should speak to his own friend. And he would return to the camp, but his attendant, Iesous son of Naue, a young man, would not go out of the tent.<verse eid="EXO 33:11"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:12"/>And Moyses said to the Lord, "Look, you say to me, 'Lead up this people!' but you did not disclose to me whom you would send along with me. And you said to me, 'I have known you above all others, and you have favor with me.'<verse eid="EXO 33:12"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:13"/>If then I have found favor before you, disclose yourself to me. Let me see you recognizably in order that I might find favor before you and in order that I might know that this nation is your people."<verse eid="EXO 33:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:14"/>And he says, "I myself will go before you, and I will give you rest."<verse eid="EXO 33:14"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:15"/>And he says to him, "If you yourself do not go, do not lead me up from here.<verse eid="EXO 33:15"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 33:17"/>Then the Lord said to Moyses, "Even this word that you have spoken, I will do for you. For you have found favor before me, and I know you above all others."<verse eid="EXO 33:17"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:18"/>And he says, "Show me your own glory!"<verse eid="EXO 33:18"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:19"/>And he said, "I will pass by before you in my glory, and I will call by my name "Lord" before you. And I will have mercy on whomever I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I have compassion."<verse eid="EXO 33:19"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:20"/>And he said, "You shall not be able to see my face. For a person shall never see my face and live."<verse eid="EXO 33:20"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:21"/>And the Lord said, "Look, a place is near me. You shall stand on the rock.<verse eid="EXO 33:21"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 33:22"/>Now, whenever my glory passes by, then I will put you in a hole of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I pass by.<verse eid="EXO 33:22"/>

  <chapter sid="EXO 34"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:1"/>And the Lord said to Moyses, "Cut for yourself two stone tablets, just like the first ones, and ascend to me onto the mountain, and I will write upon the tablets the words that were on the first tablets that you shattered,<verse eid="EXO 34:1"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:2"/>and be prepared for the morning, and you shall come up onto the mountain, Sina, and shall stand there for me on the top of the mountain.<verse eid="EXO 34:2"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:3"/>And let no one come up with you or be seen in all the mountain. And do not let the sheep and the cattle graze near that mountain."<verse eid="EXO 34:3"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:4"/>And he cut two stone tablets, just like the first ones. And when it was early in the morning, Moyses went up onto the mountain, Sina, just as the Lord instructed him. And Moyses took with him the two stone tablets.<verse eid="EXO 34:4"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:5"/>And the Lord descended in a cloud, and he stood beside him there, and he called in the name of the Lord.<verse eid="EXO 34:5"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:6"/>And the Lord passed by before his face, and he called, "The Lord, the Lord God is compassionate and merciful, patient and very merciful and truthful<verse eid="EXO 34:6"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 34:8"/>And quickly, bowing down to the earth, Moyses did obeisance<verse eid="EXO 34:8"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:9"/>and said, "If I have found favor before you, let my Lord go together with us. For the people are stiff-necked, and you shall take away our sins and lawless acts, and we will be yours."<verse eid="EXO 34:9"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:10"/>And the Lord said to Moyses: Look, I am making a covenant with you. Before all your people I shall do glorious things that have not happened in all the earth and in any nation. And all the people among whom you are will see the works of the Lord because the things that I will do for you are awesome.<verse eid="EXO 34:10"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 34:28"/>And Moyses was there before the Lord for forty days and forty nights. He did not eat bread and he did not drink water. And he wrote these words on the tablets of the covenant, the Ten Words.<verse eid="EXO 34:28"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:29"/>And as Moyses was descending from the mountain, the two tablets also were in Moyses' hands. Now as he was descending from the mountain, Moyses did not know that the appearance of the skin of his face was charged with glory while he was speaking to him.<verse eid="EXO 34:29"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:30"/>And Aaron and all the elders of Israel saw Moyses, and the appearance of the skin of his face was charged with glory, and they were afraid to come near to him.<verse eid="EXO 34:30"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:31"/>And Moyses called them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation turned to him, and Moyses spoke to them.<verse eid="EXO 34:31"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 34:32"/>And after these things all the sons of Israel drew near to him, and he commanded them all the things that the Lord said to him on the mountain, Sina.<verse eid="EXO 34:32"/>

  <chapter sid="EXO 35"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 35:1"/>And Moyses assembled the entire congregation of the sons of Israel and said to them: These are the words that the Lord said to do them:<verse eid="EXO 35:1"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 40:13"/>(15) and you shall anoint them in the same way you anointed their father, and they shall serve me as priests, and it shall be so that their anointing for priesthood is forever for their generations.<verse eid="EXO 40:13"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 40:14"/>(16) And Moyses did all the things that the Lord commanded him; so he did.<verse eid="EXO 40:14"/>

    <verse sid="EXO 40:29"/>(35) And Moyses was unable to enter into the tent of witness, because the cloud was overshadowing it, and the tent was filled with the glory of the Lord.<verse eid="EXO 40:29"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 40:30"/>(36) Now whenever the cloud lifted from the tent, the sons of Israel moved camp with their household stuff.<verse eid="EXO 40:30"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 40:31"/>(37) But if the cloud did not lift, they did not move camp until the day in which the cloud lifted.<verse eid="EXO 40:31"/>
    <verse sid="EXO 40:32"/>(38) For cloud was over the tent by day and fire was over it by night before all Israel in all their journeyings.<verse eid="EXO 40:32"/>
