  <chapter sid="1MA 1"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:1"/>And it happened after the triumph of Alexander the Macedonian the son of Philip, who came out of the land of Chettiim and defeated Darius, king of the Persians and Medes, and became king in his place, formerly being king of Greece--<verse eid="1MA 1:1"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:2"/>and he conducted many wars and seized fortresses and slaughtered the kings of the earth.<verse eid="1MA 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:3"/>And he penetrated to the ends of the earth and took the spoils of a multitude of nations. And the earth became quiet before him, and he was exalted, and his heart was uplifted.<verse eid="1MA 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:4"/>And he gathered a very powerful force and ruled over countries, nations and tyrants, and they became tributary to him.<verse eid="1MA 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:5"/>And after this he fell upon his bed and knew that he was dying.<verse eid="1MA 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:6"/>And he called his distinguished servants, who had been raised with him from their youth, and divided his kingdom among them while he was still living.<verse eid="1MA 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:7"/>And Alexander ruled for twelve years and died.<verse eid="1MA 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:8"/>And his servants took control, each in his own place.<verse eid="1MA 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:9"/>And they all put on crowns after he died, as did their sons after them for many years, and they multiplied evils on the earth.<verse eid="1MA 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:10"/>And out of them arose a sinful root, Antiochus Epiphanes son of Antiochus the king, who had been a hostage in Rome and became king in the one hundred thirty-seventh year of the kingdom of the Greeks.<verse eid="1MA 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:11"/>In those days out of Israel came sons, transgressors of the law, and persuaded many, saying, "Let us go and make a covenant with the nations around us, because from the time we separated ourselves from them many evils have found us."<verse eid="1MA 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:12"/>And the proposition seemed good in their eyes;<verse eid="1MA 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:13"/>so some of the people took courage and went to the king, and he gave them the authority to follow the statutes of the nations.<verse eid="1MA 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:14"/>And they built a gymnasium in Hierosolyma according to the precepts of the nations,<verse eid="1MA 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:15"/>and they fashioned foreskins for themselves and apostatized from the holy covenant and joined themselves to the nations and sold themselves to do evil.<verse eid="1MA 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:16"/>And the kingdom was ready in the sight of Antiochus, and he undertook to become king of the land of Egypt so that he might rule over the two kingdoms.<verse eid="1MA 1:16"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:17"/>And he invaded Egypt with a heavily armed host, with chariots and elephants and a large fleet.<verse eid="1MA 1:17"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:18"/>And he made war against Ptolemy, king of Egypt, and Ptolemy turned from before him and fled, and many fell wounded.<verse eid="1MA 1:18"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:19"/>And they seized the fortified cities in the land of Egypt, and he took the spoils of the land of Egypt.<verse eid="1MA 1:19"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:20"/>And Antiochus returned after conquering Egypt in the one hundred forty-third year and went up against Israel and went up against Hierosolyma with a heavily armed host.<verse eid="1MA 1:20"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:21"/>And he entered the holy precinct with arrogance and took the golden altar and the lamp stand for the light and all its utensils<verse eid="1MA 1:21"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:22"/>and the table of presentation and the libation bowls and the saucers and the golden censers and the veil and the crowns, and he stripped off all the gold ornamentation on the façade of the shrine.<verse eid="1MA 1:22"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:23"/>And he took the silver and the gold and the precious vessels, and he took the hidden treasures, which he found.<verse eid="1MA 1:23"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:24"/>And taking everything, he left for his own land and carried out murder and spoke with great arrogance.<verse eid="1MA 1:24"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:25"/>And there was great mourning in Israel, in every place of theirs.<verse eid="1MA 1:25"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:26"/>And rulers and elders groaned, virgins and young men weakened, and the beauty of the women was deformed.<verse eid="1MA 1:26"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:27"/>Every bridegroom took up lamentation; she who sat in the bridal chamber was in mourning.<verse eid="1MA 1:27"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:28"/>And the land quaked for those dwelling in it, and all the house of Iakob was clothed with shame.<verse eid="1MA 1:28"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:29"/>Two years later the king sent a chief revenue agent to the cities of Iouda, and he came to Ierousalem with a heavily-armed host.<verse eid="1MA 1:29"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:30"/>And he spoke peaceful words to them with deceit, and they trusted him. But he fell upon the city suddenly and struck it a great blow, and he destroyed many people from Israel.<verse eid="1MA 1:30"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:31"/>And he took the spoils of the city and burned it with fire and tore down its houses and the walls around it.<verse eid="1MA 1:31"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:32"/>And they took the women and the children captive and took possession of the livestock.<verse eid="1MA 1:32"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:33"/>And they reconstructed the city of Dauid with a large and fortified wall with fortified towers, and it became a citadel for them.<verse eid="1MA 1:33"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:34"/>And they stationed a sinful nation there, lawless men, and they became strong in it.<verse eid="1MA 1:34"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:35"/>And they stockpiled weapons and food, and gathering the plunder of Ierousalem, they stored it there and became a great threat.<verse eid="1MA 1:35"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:36"/>It<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:36</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the citadel'</char></note> became an ambush for the holy precinct and an evil enemy to Israel continuously.<verse eid="1MA 1:36"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:37"/>And they poured out innocent blood around the holy precinct and defiled the sanctuary.<verse eid="1MA 1:37"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:38"/>And the residents of Ierousalem left because of them, and it became a residence for foreigners and became foreign to those born of her, and her children abandoned her.<verse eid="1MA 1:38"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:39"/>Her holy precinct became deserted as a wilderness; her feasts were turned to mourning, her sabbaths to disgrace, her honor to scorn.<verse eid="1MA 1:39"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:40"/>Her dishonor was multiplied to equal her former glory, and her exaltation was turned to mourning.<verse eid="1MA 1:40"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:41"/>And the king wrote to all his kingdom for all to be as one people<verse eid="1MA 1:41"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:42"/>and for each to abandon his own precepts; all the nations complied with the dictum of the king.<verse eid="1MA 1:42"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:43"/>And many also from Israel approved of his service and sacrificed to idols and profaned the sabbath.<verse eid="1MA 1:43"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:44"/>And the king sent documents carried by the hand of messengers to Ierousalem and the cities of Iouda for them to follow precepts foreign to the land<verse eid="1MA 1:44"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:45"/>and to withhold whole burnt offerings and sacrifice and libation from the holy precinct and to profane sabbaths and feasts<verse eid="1MA 1:45"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:46"/>and to defile holy precinct and holy ones,<verse eid="1MA 1:46"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:47"/>to build altarsb and sacred precincts and houses to idols and to sacrifice swine and common animals<verse eid="1MA 1:47"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:48"/>and to leave their sons uncircumcised, to make their souls abominable in every unclean and profane thing,<verse eid="1MA 1:48"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:49"/>so as to forget the law and to change all the statutes.<verse eid="1MA 1:49"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:50"/>And whoever would not abide by the command of the king would die.<verse eid="1MA 1:50"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:51"/>According to all these words he wrote to all his kingdom and appointed supervisors over all the people and commanded all the cities of Iouda to sacrifice city by city.<verse eid="1MA 1:51"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:52"/>And many of the people joined them, everyone who abandoned the law, and they did evil in the land.<verse eid="1MA 1:52"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:53"/>And they forced Israel into hiding places, into every one of their places of refuge.<verse eid="1MA 1:53"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:54"/>And on the fifteenth day of Chaseleu in the one hundred and forty-fifth year, he<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:54</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'Antiochus'</char></note> constructed an abomination of desolation on the altar, and in the cities around Iouda they built altars<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:54</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Greek = 'bômos'</char></note><verse eid="1MA 1:54"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:55"/>and burned incense at the doors of the houses and in the city squares.<verse eid="1MA 1:55"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:56"/>And the books of the law which they found they tore up and burned with fire.<verse eid="1MA 1:56"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:57"/>And wherever there was found in someone's possession a book of the covenant, or if someone was conforming to the law, the judgment of the king put them to death.<verse eid="1MA 1:57"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:58"/>And they were using their power on those who were found in Israel month by month in the cities.<verse eid="1MA 1:58"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:59"/>On the twenty-fifth of the month they were sacrificing on the altar<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:59</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Greek = 'bômos'</char></note> that was on top of the sacrificial altar.<verse eid="1MA 1:59"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:60"/>And the women who had circumcised their children they put to death according to the ordinance,<verse eid="1MA 1:60"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:61"/>and they hung the babies from their necks and put to death their families and those who circumcised them.<verse eid="1MA 1:61"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:62"/>But many in Israel remained strong and fortified themselves not to eat common things.<verse eid="1MA 1:62"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:63"/>And they preferred to die so as not to be contaminated by food and not to defile the holy covenant, and they died.<verse eid="1MA 1:63"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 1:64"/>And there was a very great wrath upon Israel.<verse eid="1MA 1:64"/>



  <chapter sid="1MA 2"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:1"/>In those days Mattathias son of Ioannes son of Symeon, a priest of the sons of Ioarib, left Ierousalem and settled in Modein.<verse eid="1MA 2:1"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:2"/>And he had five sons, Ioannes, who was called Gaddi,<verse eid="1MA 2:2"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:3"/>Simon, who was called Thassi,<verse eid="1MA 2:3"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:4"/>Ioudas, who was called Makkabaios,<verse eid="1MA 2:4"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:5"/>Eleazaros, who was called Auaran, Ionathes, who was called Apphous.<verse eid="1MA 2:5"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:6"/>And he saw the blasphemies occurring in Iouda and in Ierousalem<verse eid="1MA 2:6"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:7"/>and said, "Woe to me, why was I born to see this, the destruction of my people and the destruction of the holy city? And they lived there when it<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the city'</char></note> was delivered into the hands of enemies, the holy precinct into the hands of foreigners.<verse eid="1MA 2:7"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:8"/>And her shrine became as a man without honor.<verse eid="1MA 2:8"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:9"/>The vessels of her glory were taken captive. Her infants were killed in her city squares, her young people by the sword of an enemy.<verse eid="1MA 2:9"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:10"/>What nation did not possess her in its kingdom nor seize her spoils?<verse eid="1MA 2:10"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:11"/>All her adornment was removed; from being free she became a slave.<verse eid="1MA 2:11"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:12"/>And look, our holy places<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'holy places':  I.e. 'temple'</char></note>, our beauty and our glory were devastated. And the nations defiled them.<verse eid="1MA 2:12"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:13"/>Why is there still life in us?"<verse eid="1MA 2:13"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:14"/>And Mattathias and his sons tore their garments and put on sackcloth and mourned intensely.<verse eid="1MA 2:14"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:15"/>And the agents of the king, who were enforcing the apostasy, came to the city of Modein to sacrifice.<verse eid="1MA 2:15"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:16"/>And many from Israel came to them, and Mattathias and his sons gathered together.<verse eid="1MA 2:16"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:17"/>And the agents of the king answered and said to Mattathias, saying, "You are a ruler, both glorious and great in this city, and supported by sons and brothers.<verse eid="1MA 2:17"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:18"/>Now you come forward first and execute the ordinance of the king, as have done all the nations and the men of Iouda and those remaining in Ierousalem. And you and your sons will be among the Friends of the king, and you and your sons will be glorified with silver and gold and much compensation."<verse eid="1MA 2:18"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:19"/>And Mattathias answered and said with a loud voice, "If all the nations which are in the realm of the king obey him so as to apostatize, each one from the religion of their fathers, and adopt his commandments,<verse eid="1MA 2:19"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:20"/>both I and my sons and my brothers will walk in the covenant of our fathers.<verse eid="1MA 2:20"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:21"/>God help us if we abandon the law and the statutes;<verse eid="1MA 2:21"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:22"/>we will not obey the words of the king nor deviate from our religion to the right or to the left."<verse eid="1MA 2:22"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:23"/>And as he finished speaking these words, a Judean man came within sight of all to sacrifice on the altar<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:23</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Greek ='bômos'</char></note> in Modein in accordance with the ordinance of the king.<verse eid="1MA 2:23"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:24"/>And Mattathias saw this, and he became zealous, and his kidneys became stirred up. And his anger arose in judgment. And running, he slaughtered him on the altar<verse eid="1MA 2:24"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:25"/>and killed the agent of the king, who was forcing them to sacrifice at that time, and tore down the altar.<verse eid="1MA 2:25"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:26"/>And he became zealous in the law as Phinees had done against Zambri son of Salom.<verse eid="1MA 2:26"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:27"/>And Mattathias cried out in the city with a loud voice, saying, "Let everyone who is zealous in the law and is upholding the covenant follow me."<verse eid="1MA 2:27"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:28"/>And he and his sons fled to the mountains and abandoned everything they had in the city.<verse eid="1MA 2:28"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:29"/>At that time many who were seeking righteousness and judgment descended to the wilderness to live there,<verse eid="1MA 2:29"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:30"/>they, their sons, their wives and their livestock, because evils worsened upon them.<verse eid="1MA 2:30"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:31"/>And it was announced to the king's men and to his forces that were in Ierousalem, the city of Dauid, that the men who had spurned the commandment of the king went into hiding in the wilderness.<verse eid="1MA 2:31"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:32"/>And many chased after them and overtaking them, marshaled against them and engaged them in battle on the day of the sabbaths.<verse eid="1MA 2:32"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:33"/>And they said to them, "Enough! Come out, and do according to the dictum of the king, and you will live."<verse eid="1MA 2:33"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:34"/>And they said, "We will not come out. Nor will we execute the dictum of the king to defile the day of the sabbaths."<verse eid="1MA 2:34"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:35"/>And they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:35</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the enemy'</char></note> increased the battle against them.<verse eid="1MA 2:35"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:36"/>But they neither answered them nor threw a stone against them nor even secured their hiding places,<verse eid="1MA 2:36"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:37"/>saying, "Let us all die in our simplicity. Heaven and earth bear witness to us that you destroy us unjustly."<verse eid="1MA 2:37"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:38"/>And they fell upon them in battle on the sabbaths, and they and their wives and their children and their livestock died, as many as one thousand human souls.<verse eid="1MA 2:38"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:39"/>And Mattathias and his friends learned of this, and they mourned over them greatly.<verse eid="1MA 2:39"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:40"/>And they said, a man to his neighbor, "If we all do as our brothers did and do not fight against the nations for our lives and for our statutes, now quickly they will annihilate us from the land."<verse eid="1MA 2:40"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:41"/>And they decided on that day saying, "Every person who comes against us in battle on the day of the sabbaths, let us fight against them, and we will not all die as our brothers died in the hiding places."<verse eid="1MA 2:41"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:42"/>At that time a gathering of Hasideans joined together with them, strong in power, from Israel, every one of them volunteering for the law.<verse eid="1MA 2:42"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:43"/>And all the fugitives from the evils were added to them and became a support for them.<verse eid="1MA 2:43"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:44"/>And they assembled a force and struck down sinners in their wrath and lawless men in their anger, and the rest fled to the nations to be saved.<verse eid="1MA 2:44"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:45"/>And Mattathias and his friends went around and tore down the altars<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:45</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Greek ='bômos'</char></note><verse eid="1MA 2:45"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:46"/>and circumcised by force all the uncircumcised boys they found within the borders of Israel.<verse eid="1MA 2:46"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:47"/>And they persecuted the children of insolence, and their mission was successful by their hand.<verse eid="1MA 2:47"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:48"/>And they reclaimed the law out of the hands of the nations and out of the hands of the kings, and they gave no support to the sinner.<verse eid="1MA 2:48"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:49"/>And the days drew near for Mattathias to die, and he said to his sons, "Now arrogance and reproach have been established, a time of destruction and fierce wrath.<verse eid="1MA 2:49"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:50"/>Now, children, be zealous in the law, and give your lives for the covenant of our fathers.<verse eid="1MA 2:50"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:51"/>"Remember the works of our fathers, which they did in their generations, and receive great glory and an everlasting name.<verse eid="1MA 2:51"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:52"/>Was not Abraam found faithful in temptation, and it was accounted to him as righteousness?<verse eid="1MA 2:52"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:53"/>Ioseph in the time of his affliction observed the commandment and became lord of Egypt.<verse eid="1MA 2:53"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:54"/>Phinees our father, by becoming zealous with zeal, received a covenant of everlasting priesthood.<verse eid="1MA 2:54"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:55"/>Iesous, by fulfilling the command, became a judge in Israel.<verse eid="1MA 2:55"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:56"/>Chaleb, by bearing witness in the assembly, received an inheritance of land.<verse eid="1MA 2:56"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:57"/>Dauid, by his mercy, inherited the throne of a kingdom forever.<verse eid="1MA 2:57"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:58"/>Elias, by becoming greatly zealous for the law, was taken up into heaven.<verse eid="1MA 2:58"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:59"/>Hananias, Azarias and Misael, because of their faith, were saved from fire.<verse eid="1MA 2:59"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:60"/>Daniel, by his simplicity, was rescued from the mouth of lions.<verse eid="1MA 2:60"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:61"/>"Therefore, keep in mind from generation to generation that all who hope in him will not weaken.<verse eid="1MA 2:61"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:62"/>And do not fear on account of the words of a sinner, because their glory will become dung and worms.<verse eid="1MA 2:62"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:63"/>Today they will be elevated, but tomorrow they will not be found, because they will have returned to their dust and their counsels will be lost.<verse eid="1MA 2:63"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:64"/>Children, be brave, and be strong in the law, for by it you will be glorified.<verse eid="1MA 2:64"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:65"/>"And look, Symeon your brother, I know that he is a man of counsel. Hear him all the days. He shall be as a father to you.<verse eid="1MA 2:65"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:66"/>And Ioudas Makkabaios has been strong in power since his youth. He shall be commander of the army and shall fight the war of the peoples.<verse eid="1MA 2:66"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:67"/>And you shall draw to you all those who observe the law and execute vengeance for your people.<verse eid="1MA 2:67"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:68"/>Return what is due to the nations, and be attentive to the ordinance of the law."<verse eid="1MA 2:68"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:69"/>And he blessed them and was joined to his fathers.<verse eid="1MA 2:69"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 2:70"/>And he died in the one hundred forty-sixth year and was buried among the tombs of his ancestors in Modein. And all Israel mourned for him with great mourning.<verse eid="1MA 2:70"/>



  <chapter sid="1MA 3"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:1"/>And Ioudas his son who was called Makkabaios, rose up in his place,<verse eid="1MA 3:1"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:2"/>and all his brothers helped him, as did all who had joined his father. And they fought the war for Israel with gladness.<verse eid="1MA 3:2"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:3"/>And he spread glory to his people and put on a breastplate like a giant and strapped on his war instruments. And he conducted battles, protecting the camp by the sword.<verse eid="1MA 3:3"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:4"/>And he resembled a lion in his works and was like a whelp roaring in the hunt.<verse eid="1MA 3:4"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:5"/>And seeking out the lawless, he persecuted them and burned up those who disturbed his people.<verse eid="1MA 3:5"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:6"/>And the lawless drew back for fear of him, and all the workers of lawlessness were disturbed, and salvation was successful by his hand.<verse eid="1MA 3:6"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:7"/>And he caused bitterness to many kings, and gladness to Iakob by his works, and his memory will be a blessing forever.<verse eid="1MA 3:7"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:8"/>And he went through the cities of Iouda and annihilated the impious from it and turned away wrath from Israel.<verse eid="1MA 3:8"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:9"/>And his name was known to the ends of the earth, and he gathered together those who were lost.<verse eid="1MA 3:9"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:10"/>And Apollonius gathered together the nations and a large force from Samaria, to make war against Israel.<verse eid="1MA 3:10"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:11"/>And Ioudas found out, and he went out to meet him. And he struck and killed him. And many fell wounded, and the rest fled.<verse eid="1MA 3:11"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:12"/>And they took their spoils, and Ioudas took the dagger of Apollonius and fought with it all his days.<verse eid="1MA 3:12"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:13"/>And Seron, the commander of the force of Syria, heard that Ioudas had gathered a force and an assembly of troops loyal to him who were going out with him to battle.<verse eid="1MA 3:13"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:14"/>And he said, "I will make a name for myself and will be glorified in the kingdom. And I will make war on Ioudas and those with him who disregard the dictum of the king."<verse eid="1MA 3:14"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:15"/>And there was added a powerful company of impious men, and it went up with him to help him take revenge on the descendants of Israel.<verse eid="1MA 3:15"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:16"/>And he drew near to the ascent of Baithoron, and Ioudas went out to meet him with few companions.<verse eid="1MA 3:16"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:17"/>But as they saw the company coming to meet them, they said to Ioudas, "How will we, being so few, be able to fight against such a powerful multitude? And we are weak, having eaten nothing today."<verse eid="1MA 3:17"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:18"/>And Ioudas said, "It is easy for many to be ensnared by the hands of a few. And it makes no difference before heaven to save by many or by a few.<verse eid="1MA 3:18"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:19"/>For victory in war is not in the multitude of force, but rather, power is from heaven.<verse eid="1MA 3:19"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:20"/>They come against us with great arrogance and lawlessness, to eliminate us and our wives and our children, to despoil us.<verse eid="1MA 3:20"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:21"/>But we fight for our lives and our precepts,<verse eid="1MA 3:21"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:22"/>and he himself will smash them before us. You, therefore, do not be afraid of them."<verse eid="1MA 3:22"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:23"/>When he had finished speaking, he drove upon them suddenly. And Seron and his company were smashed before him.<verse eid="1MA 3:23"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:24"/>And they pursued him on the descent of Baithoron down to the plain. And eight hundred men of them fell, and the rest fled to the land of Phylistiim.<verse eid="1MA 3:24"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:25"/>Thus began the fear of Ioudas and his brothers, and dread fell upon the nations all around them.<verse eid="1MA 3:25"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:26"/>And his name reached the king himself, and every nation was discussing the battles of Ioudas.<verse eid="1MA 3:26"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:27"/>But when Antiochus heard these words, he raged in anger and sent for and gathered together all the forces of his kingdom, a very powerful company.<verse eid="1MA 3:27"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:28"/>And he opened his treasury and gave rations to his forces for a year. And he commanded them to be prepared for every service.<verse eid="1MA 3:28"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:29"/>But he saw that the money from the treasuries had given out, and the taxes of the country were few because of the dissension and affliction that he had brought upon the land by revoking the precepts, which existed from the first days.<verse eid="1MA 3:29"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:30"/>And he was concerned that he might not have as much as he usually had for his expenditures and for the gifts, which he used to give before with a liberal hand when he exceeded the kings preceding him.<verse eid="1MA 3:30"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:31"/>And he was greatly frustrated in his soul and decided to go to Persia and to take the taxes from those countries and to gather much money.<verse eid="1MA 3:31"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:32"/>And he left Lysias, a distinguished man of the royal family, over the affairs of the king from the Euphrates river to the borders of Egypt<verse eid="1MA 3:32"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:33"/>and to raise Antiochus his son until he returned.<verse eid="1MA 3:33"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:34"/>And he gave to him<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:34</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 3:37"/>And the king took the half of the forces that remained and departed from Antioch, from the city of his kingdom in the one hundred and forty-seventh year. And he crossed over the Euphrates river and went through the upper countries.<verse eid="1MA 3:37"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:38"/>And Lysias selected Ptolemy son of Dorymenes and Nicanor and Gorgias, powerful men from the Friends of the king,<verse eid="1MA 3:38"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 3:41"/>And the merchants of the land heard their name, and they took silver and very much gold and shackles and came to the camp to take the sons of Israel as servants. And there were added to them a force from Syria and from the land of the allophyles.<verse eid="1MA 3:41"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:42"/>And Ioudas and his brothers saw that the evils were multiplied and that the forces were camped within their borders and learned of the orders of the king, which he had commanded to do to the people for destruction and annihilation,<verse eid="1MA 3:42"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 3:43"/>and they said, each to his neighbor, "Let us raise up the ruination of our people and make war for our people and the holy places<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:43</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'holy places':  I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 3:45"/>And Ierousalem was uninhabited like a wilderness. There was no one going in or going out of those born of her. And the holy precinct was downtrodden, and sons of aliens were in the citadel, a dwelling-place for the nations.

    <verse sid="1MA 3:48"/>And they spread out the book of the law, seeking that concerning which the nations inquire of the images of their idols.<verse eid="1MA 3:48"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 4:1"/>And Gorgias took five thousand men and one thousand select cavalry. And the company departed by night<verse eid="1MA 4:1"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:2"/>in order to fall upon the camp of the Judeans and strike them suddenly. And the sons of the citadel were his guides.<verse eid="1MA 4:2"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:3"/>And Ioudas learned this, and he and his strongest men went out to defeat the force of the king, which was at Ammaous,<verse eid="1MA 4:3"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:4"/>while the forces were still scattered from the camp.<verse eid="1MA 4:4"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:5"/>And Gorgias arrived at the camp of Ioudas at night and found no one, and he sought them in the mountains, because he said, "These men are fleeing from us."<verse eid="1MA 4:5"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:6"/>And at daybreak Ioudas was seen in the plain with three thousand men, except that they had no coverings<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'shields'</char></note> and dagger as they wanted.<verse eid="1MA 4:6"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:7"/>And they saw the camp of the nations, strong, heavily-defended and with cavalry encircling it, and these were instructed for war.<verse eid="1MA 4:7"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:8"/>And Ioudas said to the men who were with him, "Do not fear their multitude, and do not be cowardly at their charge.<verse eid="1MA 4:8"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:9"/>Remember how our fathers were saved in the Red Sea when Pharao was pursuing them in force.<verse eid="1MA 4:9"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 4:11"/>And all the nations will know that there is one who redeems and saves Israel."<verse eid="1MA 4:11"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:12"/>And the allophyles lifted up their eyes and saw them coming from the opposite side,<verse eid="1MA 4:12"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:13"/>and they came out of the camp to battle. And those who were with Ioudas trumpeted<verse eid="1MA 4:13"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:14"/>and joined battle with them. And the nations were smashed and fled to the plain.<verse eid="1MA 4:14"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:15"/>But all the hindmost fell by the sword. And they pursued them as far as Gazera and as far as the flatlands of Idumea, Azotus and Jamnia, and of them three thousand men fell.<verse eid="1MA 4:15"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:16"/>And Ioudas and his force returned from chasing after them.<verse eid="1MA 4:16"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:17"/>And he said to the people, "Do not desire plunder, for the battle is before us.<verse eid="1MA 4:17"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 4:19"/>Just as Ioudas was concluding these things, a certain detachment was seen peering out of the mountain.<verse eid="1MA 4:19"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:20"/>And they saw that they had been routed, and they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:20</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 4:21"/>Now when they comprehended these things, they became very frightened. And perceiving also the army of Ioudas in the plain ready in battle order,<verse eid="1MA 4:21"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:22"/>they all fled to the land of the allophyles.<verse eid="1MA 4:22"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:23"/>And Ioudas turned to the plundering of the camp, and they took much gold and silver, blue and sea purple cloth and great wealth.<verse eid="1MA 4:23"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 4:25"/>And a great salvation came about in Israel on that day.<verse eid="1MA 4:25"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:26"/>And as many of the allophyles survived, when they arrived, they informed Lysias of everything that had happened.<verse eid="1MA 4:26"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:27"/>Upon hearing, he became confused and disheartened, because things that he did not want had happened to Israel, and what resulted was not what the king had commanded him.<verse eid="1MA 4:27"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:28"/>And in the following year he mustered sixty thousand select men and five thousand cavalry in order to make war on them.<verse eid="1MA 4:28"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:29"/>And they came into Idumea and camped at Baithsoura, and Ioudas met them with ten thousand men.<verse eid="1MA 4:29"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:30"/>And he saw the powerful army, and he prayed and said, "Blessed are you, the savior of Israel, who smashed the attack of the powerful one by the hand of your slave Dauid and delivered the camp of the allophyles into the hands of Ionathes son of Saoul and of the bearer of his armor.<verse eid="1MA 4:30"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:31"/>Entrap this camp in the hand of your people Israel, and let them be put to shame in their army and their cavalry.<verse eid="1MA 4:31"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 4:34"/>And they joined battle with each other, and from the army of Lysias fell five thousand men, and they fell from before them.<verse eid="1MA 4:34"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:35"/>And seeing the developing rout of his own formation but the complete boldness of Ioudas and how they were ready to live or die bravely, Lysias departed to Antioch and was enlisting foreign troops, [and] becoming numerous again in order to return to Judea.<verse eid="1MA 4:35"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:36"/>But Ioudas and his brothers said, "Look, our enemies have been smashed.

    <verse sid="1MA 4:37"/>And the whole company gathered together and went up to Mount Sion.<verse eid="1MA 4:37"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:38"/>And they saw the holy precinct desolate and the altar defiled and the doors burned and plants growing in the courts as in a thicket or as in one of the mountains and the chambers of the priests demolished.<verse eid="1MA 4:38"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:39"/>And they tore their garments and mourned with great mourning. And they spread ashes on themselves<verse eid="1MA 4:39"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:40"/>and fell on their faces on the ground. And they trumpeted with the signal trumpets and cried out to heaven.<verse eid="1MA 4:40"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:41"/>Then Ioudas ordered men to fight those in the citadel until he could purify the holy places<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:41</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'holy places':  I.e. 'temple'</char></note>.<verse eid="1MA 4:41"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 4:42"/>And he selected uncorrupted priests, devotees of the law,<verse eid="1MA 4:42"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 4:45"/>And there fell to them a good counsel, to tear it down so that it would not become a reproach to them, because the nations defiled it. And they tore down the altar<verse eid="1MA 4:45"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 4:47"/>And they took whole stones according to the law and built a new altar like the former one.<verse eid="1MA 4:47"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 4:54"/>During the same time and on the same day on which the nations defiled it, on that day it was rededicated with songs and lyres and cinyras<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:54</char><char closed="false" style="ft">= Hebrew 'kinnor' = 'lyre'</char></note> and cymbals.<verse eid="1MA 4:54"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 4:60"/>And they constructed at that time all around Mount Sion high walls and fortified towers so that the nations would not return and trample them down as they did before.<verse eid="1MA 4:60"/>

  <chapter sid="1MA 5"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 5:1"/>And it happened, when the surrounding nations heard that the altar had been built and the holy precinct had been rededicated as before, and they were greatly angered<verse eid="1MA 5:1"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 5:3"/>And Ioudas made war against the sons of Esau in Idumea, against Akrabattene, because they were besieging Israel. And he struck them a mighty blow and reduced them and took their spoils.<verse eid="1MA 5:3"/>

  <chapter sid="1MA 6"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:1"/>And King Antiochus was going through the upper lands and heard that Elymais is a city in Persia distinguished for its wealth in silver and gold.<verse eid="1MA 6:1"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 6:3"/>And he came and sought to take the city and to plunder it, and he was not able, because word of it became known to people from the city,<verse eid="1MA 6:3"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:4"/>and they stood up against him in battle. And he fled and departed from there with great sorrow to return to Babylon.<verse eid="1MA 6:4"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:5"/>And someone came to him in Persia reporting that the armies that were going to Judea had been routed<verse eid="1MA 6:5"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:6"/>and that Lysias went initially with a powerful force but was turned back from before them, and they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">6:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">', and they':  I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 6:7"/>and that they tore down the abomination that he had built on the altar in Ierousalem and encircled the holy precinct with high walls as it had been before, and also Baithsoura, his city.<verse eid="1MA 6:7"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:8"/>And it happened, when the king heard these words, he was astonished and greatly shaken, and he fell upon his bed and fell into illness from grief, because things did not happen for him as he desired.<verse eid="1MA 6:8"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:9"/>And he remained there rather many days, because intense grief mounted in him and he reckoned that he was dying.<verse eid="1MA 6:9"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:10"/>And he called all his Friends and said to them, "Sleep eludes my eyes, and I am disheartened from worry.<verse eid="1MA 6:10"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:11"/>And I said in my heart, 'To what affliction have I come, and how great is the cataclysm in which I am now?' For I was kind and beloved in my authority.<verse eid="1MA 6:11"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:12"/>But now I remember the evils which I did in Ierousalem. And I took all the silver and gold vessels that were in it, and I sent men to annihilate the inhabitants of Iouda in vain.<verse eid="1MA 6:12"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:13"/>I know that, because of these things, these evils have found me, and now look, I am perishing with great grief in a foreign land."<verse eid="1MA 6:13"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 6:15"/>And he gave him his crown and robe and the seal ring in order to guide Antiochus his son and raise him to be king.<verse eid="1MA 6:15"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:16"/>And Antiochus the king died there in the one hundred forty-ninth year.<verse eid="1MA 6:16"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:17"/>And Lysias found out that the king had died, and he established Antiochus his son to be king in his place, whom he had raised as a youth, and he called his name Eupator.<verse eid="1MA 6:17"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:18"/>And the men from the citadel had shut Israel in around the holy places<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">6:18</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'holy places':  I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 6:28"/>And the king became angry when he heard this and gathered together all his Friends, commanders of his army and those over the cavalry.<verse eid="1MA 6:28"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:29"/>And from other kingdoms and from the islands of the seas mercenary forces came to him.<verse eid="1MA 6:29"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 6:31"/>And they came through Idumea and camped at Baithsoura.

    <verse sid="1MA 6:32"/>And Ioudas departed from the citadel and camped at Baithzacharia, opposite the camp of the king.<verse eid="1MA 6:32"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:33"/>And the king arose early in the morning and led the army in haste down the road to Baithzacharia. And the forces prepared for battle and trumpeted with the trumpets.<verse eid="1MA 6:33"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:34"/>And they showed the elephants juice of grapes and black berries to incite them to war.<verse eid="1MA 6:34"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:35"/>And they divided the beasts among the phalanxes and positioned with each elephant a thousand men with chain mail breastplates and copper helmets on their heads, and there were also five hundred select cavalry assigned to each beast.<verse eid="1MA 6:35"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:36"/>These ahead of time were wherever the beast was and went with it wherever it went. They would never separate from it.<verse eid="1MA 6:36"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:37"/>And there were wooden towers on them, on each beast, sturdy, covered, tied on it with devices, and on each one were four men of strength, who fought upon them, and its Indian handler.<verse eid="1MA 6:37"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:38"/>And he stationed the rest of the cavalry on the sides at both flanks of the army as raiders and as guards for the phalanxes.<verse eid="1MA 6:38"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:39"/>Now as the sun shone on the gold and copper shields, the mountains glittered with them and glowed as lamps of fire.<verse eid="1MA 6:39"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:40"/>And a certain part of the army of the king spread out on the high mountains and some of the lower ones, and they were advancing securely and in order.<verse eid="1MA 6:40"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:41"/>And everyone trembled who heard the sound made by the multitude of them and by the marching of the multitude and the clashing of the weapons, for the army was very great and mighty.<verse eid="1MA 6:41"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 6:45"/>And he ran at him boldly, into the middle of the phalanx, and was killing to the right and to the left, and they separated before him on each side.<verse eid="1MA 6:45"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 6:46"/>And he got down under the elephant and stabbed it underneath and killed it, but it fell to the ground on top of him, and he died there.<verse eid="1MA 6:46"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 6:57"/>And he hurried and assented to withdraw and said to the king and to the leaders of the force and to the men, "We are dying out every day, and our food is limited, and the place we are besieging is strong, and the business of the kingdom is pressing upon us.<verse eid="1MA 6:57"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 7:19"/>And Bacchides departed from Ierousalem and camped at Bethzaith. And he sent and apprehended many of the men who had deserted to him and some of the people, and he killed them in the great pit.<verse eid="1MA 7:19"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:20"/>And he entrusted the country to Alcimus and left a force with him to help him, and Bacchides returned to the king.<verse eid="1MA 7:20"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:21"/>And Alcimus struggled to gain the high priesthood,<verse eid="1MA 7:21"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:22"/>and all those who were stirring up their people joined together with him. And they prevailed over the land of Iouda and did great harm in Israel.<verse eid="1MA 7:22"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:23"/>And Ioudas saw all the evil that Alcimus and those with him had done to the sons of Israel, which was more than the nations had done.<verse eid="1MA 7:23"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:24"/>And he went out into all the regions all around Judea and executed vengeance on the men who had deserted, and they were prevented from going out into the country.<verse eid="1MA 7:24"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:25"/>But when Alcimus saw that Ioudas and those with him had strengthened, he also knew that he would not be able to resist them, and he returned to the king and denounced their misdeeds.<verse eid="1MA 7:25"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:26"/>And the king sent Nicanor, one of his distinguished commanders, who hated and was hostile to Israel, and he commanded him to annihilate the people.<verse eid="1MA 7:26"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:27"/>And Nicanor came to Ierousalem with a large force and sent a message to Ioudas and his brothers with peaceful words with deceit, saying,<verse eid="1MA 7:27"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:28"/>"Let there be no warfare between me and you. I will come with a few men in order to see you personally with peace."<verse eid="1MA 7:28"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:29"/>And he came to Ioudas, and they greeted each other peacefully, but the enemies were ready to seize Ioudas.<verse eid="1MA 7:29"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:30"/>Word of this became known to Ioudas, that he came to him with deceit, and he became terrified of him and did not want to see his face again.<verse eid="1MA 7:30"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:31"/>Nicanor learned that his plan had been revealed, and he came out to meet Ioudas in battle near Chapharsalama.<verse eid="1MA 7:31"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:32"/>Around five hundred men of those with Nicanor fell, and they fled to the city of Dauid.<verse eid="1MA 7:32"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:33"/>After these developments Nicanor went up to Mount Sion, and some of the priests from the holy places<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">7:33</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'holy places':  I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 7:34"/>But he mocked them and ridiculed them and defiled them and spoke arrogantly.<verse eid="1MA 7:34"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:35"/>And he swore with anger, saying, "If Ioudas and his army do not surrender themselves into my hands now, in the future, if I return in peace, I will burn down this house." And he went out with great anger.<verse eid="1MA 7:35"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:36"/>And the priests went in and stood in front of the altar and the shrine and wept and said,<verse eid="1MA 7:36"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:37"/>"You have selected this house for your name to be invoked in it, to be a house of prayer and supplication for your people.<verse eid="1MA 7:37"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:38"/>Execute vengeance on this man and on his army, and let them fall by the sword. Remember their blasphemies, and do not allow them to endure."<verse eid="1MA 7:38"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:39"/>And Nicanor went out of Ierousalem and camped in Baithoron, and the Syrian force met him.<verse eid="1MA 7:39"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:40"/>And Ioudas camped in Adasa with three thousand men. And Ioudas prayed and said,<verse eid="1MA 7:40"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 7:43"/>And the armies engaged in battle on the thirteenth of the month Adar. And the army of Nicanor was smashed, and he fell first in battle.<verse eid="1MA 7:43"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:44"/>And as his army saw that Nicanor fell, they threw down their weapons and fled.<verse eid="1MA 7:44"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 7:46"/>And people came out of all the surrounding villages of Judea and outflanked them, and they turned back against each other. And all of them fell by the sword, and not even one of them was left.<verse eid="1MA 7:46"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:47"/>And they took the plunder and the spoils and cut off the head of Nicanor and his right hand, which he had stretched out arrogantly, and they brought them and exhibited them in Ierousalem.<verse eid="1MA 7:47"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:48"/>And the people rejoiced greatly, and they observed that day as a day of great gladness.<verse eid="1MA 7:48"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:49"/>And they established the observation of that day every year on the thirteenth of Adar.<verse eid="1MA 7:49"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 7:50"/>And the land of Iouda became quiet for a few days.<verse eid="1MA 7:50"/>



  <chapter sid="1MA 8"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:1"/>And Ioudas heard the name of the Romans, that they were powerful in strength and were pleased with all those who allied themselves with them, that they would establish friendship with all those who come to them<verse eid="1MA 8:1"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:2"/>and that they are powerful in strength. And they recounted to him their wars and the heroic actions which they were doing with the Galatians and that they prevailed over them and made them subject to tribute<verse eid="1MA 8:2"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:3"/>and all they did in the land of Spain to gain control over the metals, the silver and the gold which was there<verse eid="1MA 8:3"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:4"/>and how they prevailed over the whole place by their strategy and patience, and the place was very far distant from them, and the kings came against them from the ends of the earth until they smashed them and struck them a great blow, while the rest give them tribute every year,<verse eid="1MA 8:4"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 8:10"/>but word of this became known to them, and they sent one general against them, and they battled against them, and many of them fell wounded, and they captured their wives and their children and plundered them and took control of their land and tore down their fortresses and enslaved them to this day.<verse eid="1MA 8:10"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:11"/>And the rest of the kingdoms and the islands, as many as ever resisted them, they devastated and enslaved them,<verse eid="1MA 8:11"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 8:14"/>And in all this not even one of them has put on a crown nor have they wrapped themselves in purple so as to show their power by it.<verse eid="1MA 8:14"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:15"/>And they built for themselves a council chamber, and every day three hundred twenty senators deliberate continuously about the multitude so that they might live in an orderly way.<verse eid="1MA 8:15"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:16"/>And they trust one man to rule them each year and to govern all their land, and they all obey the one, and there is no jealousy or envy among them.<verse eid="1MA 8:16"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:17"/>And Ioudas selected Eupolemus son of Ioannes of Akkos and Jason son of Eleazaros and sent them to Rome to establish friendship and an alliance<verse eid="1MA 8:17"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:18"/>and to lift the yoke from them, for they saw the kingdom of the Greeks enslaving Israel in servitude.<verse eid="1MA 8:18"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:19"/>And they went to Rome, and the distance was very long, and they entered into the council chamber and answered and said,<verse eid="1MA 8:19"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:20"/>"Ioudas, who is also called Makkabaios, and his brothers and the multitude of the Judeans sent us to you to establish with you an alliance and peace and to enroll us as allies and friends of yours."<verse eid="1MA 8:20"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:21"/>And the speech was pleasing to them.<verse eid="1MA 8:21"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:22"/>And this is a copy of the letter which they copied onto brass tablets and sent to Ierousalem to be with them there as a memorial of peace and alliance:<verse eid="1MA 8:22"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:23"/>"May it be well with the Romans and with the nation of the Judeans on the sea and on land forever, and may sword and enemy be removed far from them.<verse eid="1MA 8:23"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:24"/>But if war should come to Rome first or to any of their allies in all their dominion,<verse eid="1MA 8:24"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:25"/>the nation of the Judeans will be their ally with their whole heart as the time may indicate to them.<verse eid="1MA 8:25"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 8:27"/>In the same manner, if a war occurs first to the nation of the Judeans, the Romans will be their ally, willingly as the time may indicate to them.<verse eid="1MA 8:27"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 8:28"/>And to the allies will not be given wheat, weapons, silver, ships, as it seemed good to Rome. And they will keep these commitments and not with deceit.<verse eid="1MA 8:28"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 8:31"/>And concerning the evils which king Demetrius is doing to them, we have written to him saying, "Why have you made your yoke heavy on our friends and allies, the Judeans?<verse eid="1MA 8:31"/>

  <chapter sid="1MA 9"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:1"/>And Demetrius heard that Nicanor and his forces had fallen in battle; he again sent Bacchides and Alcimus for the second time to the land of Iouda, and the right flank with them.<verse eid="1MA 9:1"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:2"/>And they traveled the road to Galgala and camped against Maisaloth in Arbela and occupied it and destroyed many people's lives.<verse eid="1MA 9:2"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:3"/>And in the first month of the one hundred fifty-second year, they camped against Ierousalem,<verse eid="1MA 9:3"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:4"/>and they departed and went into Bereth with twenty thousand men and two thousand cavalry.<verse eid="1MA 9:4"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:5"/>And Ioudas was camped at Elasa, and three thousand selected men with him.<verse eid="1MA 9:5"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:6"/>And they saw the multitude of the forces, that they were many, and they became very frightened, and many melted away from the camp; there did not remain of them but eight hundred men.<verse eid="1MA 9:6"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:7"/>And Ioudas saw that his army had melted away and the battle was pressing him, and he was shattered in spirit, because he did not have time to gather them together.<verse eid="1MA 9:7"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:8"/>And he became faint and said to those who were left, "Let us arise and go up against our adversaries. Perhaps we are strong enough to do battle with them."<verse eid="1MA 9:8"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:9"/>But they deterred him, saying, "We are not strong enough, but rather, let us save our lives now. We and our brothers will return and will do battle against them. But we are few."<verse eid="1MA 9:9"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:10"/>And Ioudas said, "Far be it from me to do this thing, to flee from them. And if our time has drawn near, and let us die with courage for the sake of our brothers, and let us leave no accusation against our honor."<verse eid="1MA 9:10"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:11"/>And the force<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'of Bacchides'</char></note> departed from the camp and stood for the engagement with them. And the cavalry was divided into two parts, and the slingers and the archers went ahead of the army as did all the strong warriors.<verse eid="1MA 9:11"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:12"/>But Bacchides was on the right flank, and the phalanx approached from both sides. And they blew the trumpets, and the men with Ioudas also trumpeted with their trumpets.<verse eid="1MA 9:12"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:13"/>And the earth was shaken from the sound of the armies, and the battle was joined from the morning until evening.<verse eid="1MA 9:13"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:14"/>And Ioudas saw that Bacchides and the bulk of his army were on the right, and with him came all the bravest in heart.<verse eid="1MA 9:14"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:15"/>And the right wing was smashed by them, and he pursued them as far as Mount Azotus.<verse eid="1MA 9:15"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:16"/>And those on the left flank saw that the right flank had been smashed, and they turned on the heels of Ioudas and those with him from behind.<verse eid="1MA 9:16"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:17"/>And the fighting became heavy and many wounded fell from both sides.<verse eid="1MA 9:17"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:18"/>And Ioudas fell, and the rest fled.<verse eid="1MA 9:18"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:19"/>And Ionathan and Simon took Ioudas their brother and buried him in the tomb of their fathers in Modein<verse eid="1MA 9:19"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:20"/>and wept for him. And all Israel mourned him with great mourning and grieved many days and said,<verse eid="1MA 9:20"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:21"/>"How the mighty savior of Israel fell!"<verse eid="1MA 9:21"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:22"/>And the rest of the words of Ioudas and of the battles and heroic acts which he did and of his greatness were not written down for they were very many.<verse eid="1MA 9:22"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:23"/>And it happened after the death of Ioudas, the lawless came forth in all the regions of Israel, and all those who worked injustice arose.<verse eid="1MA 9:23"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:24"/>In those days there was a very great famine, and the country deserted with them.<verse eid="1MA 9:24"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:25"/>And Bacchides selected the impious men and established them as masters of the country.<verse eid="1MA 9:25"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:26"/>And they sought out and investigated the friends of Ioudas and led them to Bacchides, and he retaliated against them and taunted them.<verse eid="1MA 9:26"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:27"/>And there was a great affliction in Israel such as had not been since the day that a prophet was not seen among them.<verse eid="1MA 9:27"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:28"/>And all the friends of Ioudas came together and said to Ionathan,<verse eid="1MA 9:28"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:29"/>"Since your brother Ioudas has died, there is no man like him to come forward and to go against the enemy and Bacchides and those who are hostile to our nation.<verse eid="1MA 9:29"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:30"/>Now then we have chosen you today in his place to be for us a ruler and a leader to fight our war."<verse eid="1MA 9:30"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:31"/>And Ionathan accepted the leadership at that time and rose up in the place of Ioudas his brother.<verse eid="1MA 9:31"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:32"/>And Bacchides learned this, and he sought to kill him.<verse eid="1MA 9:32"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:33"/>But Ionathan and Simon his brother and all those with him found out and fled into the wilderness of Thekoe and camped at the waterhole of Asphar.<verse eid="1MA 9:33"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:34"/>And Bacchides learned this on the day of the sabbaths, and he and all his army came to the other side of the Jordan.<verse eid="1MA 9:34"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:35"/>And he sent his brother, a leader of the host, and requested of his Nabatean friends to store with them the large amount of their baggage.<verse eid="1MA 9:35"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:36"/>But the sons of Iambri from Medaba came out and seized Ioannes and everything that he had and, having them, went away.<verse eid="1MA 9:36"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:37"/>After these developments, they announced to Ionathan and to Simon his brother that the sons of Iambri are holding a big wedding and are bringing the bride from Nadabath, a daughter of one of the great nobles of Chanaan, with a large convoy.<verse eid="1MA 9:37"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:38"/>And they remembered the blood of Ioannes their brother and they went up and hid under the cover of the mountain.<verse eid="1MA 9:38"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:39"/>And they lifted up their eyes and saw and look, a commotion and a large entourage, and the bridegroom and his friends and his brothers came out to meet them with drums and musicians and many weapons.<verse eid="1MA 9:39"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:40"/>And they rose up against them from the ambush and killed them. And many wounded fell, and the rest fled to the mountain, and they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:40</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 9:41"/>And the wedding changed to mourning, and the sound of their musicians to lamentation.<verse eid="1MA 9:41"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:42"/>And they exacted vengeance for the blood of their brother and returned to the marshland of the Jordan.<verse eid="1MA 9:42"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:43"/>And Bacchides heard this, and he came on the day of the sabbaths as far as the banks of the Jordan with a large force.<verse eid="1MA 9:43"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:44"/>And Ionathan said to those with him, "Let us rise up now and fight for our lives, for today is not as yesterday or the third day.<verse eid="1MA 9:44"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:45"/>For look, the battle is before us and behind us, and the water of the Jordan is on this side and that, and there is marsh and thicket; there is no place to turn.<verse eid="1MA 9:45"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:46"/>Now then, cry out to heaven so that you may be saved from the hand of our enemies."<verse eid="1MA 9:46"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:47"/>And the battle began, and Ionathan stretched out his hand to strike Bacchides, but he turned away from him toward the rear.<verse eid="1MA 9:47"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:48"/>And Ionathan and those with him jumped into the Jordan and swam through to the other side, but they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:48</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the enemy'</char></note> did not cross through the Jordan against them.<verse eid="1MA 9:48"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:49"/>And up to a thousand men with Bacchides fell on that day.<verse eid="1MA 9:49"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:50"/>And he returned to Ierousalem and built fortified cities in Judea, the fortress in Iericho, and Ammaous and Baithoron and Baithel and Thamnatha Pharathon and Tephon with high walls and gates and bolts.<verse eid="1MA 9:50"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:51"/>And he placed a guard in them, to be hostile to Israel.<verse eid="1MA 9:51"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:52"/>And he fortified the city of Baithsoura and Gazara and the citadel, and he placed in them forces and stores of food.<verse eid="1MA 9:52"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:53"/>And he took the sons of the leaders of the country as hostages and placed them in the citadel in Ierousalem in detention.<verse eid="1MA 9:53"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:54"/>And in the one hundred and fifty-third year, in the second month, Alcimus gave the command to tear down the wall of the inner court of the holy places<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:54</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'holy places':  I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 9:55"/>but at that time Alcimus was stricken, and his works were thwarted. And his mouth was stopped up, and he was paralyzed, and he was no longer able to say a word and command about his own house.<verse eid="1MA 9:55"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:56"/>And Alcimus died at that time with great torment.<verse eid="1MA 9:56"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:57"/>And Bacchides saw that Alcimus had died, and he returned to the king, and the land of Iouda was quiet for two years.<verse eid="1MA 9:57"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:58"/>And all the lawless took counsel, saying, "Look, Ionathan and those with him live in peace confidently. Now then, we shall bring Bacchides back, and he will apprehend them all in one night."<verse eid="1MA 9:58"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:59"/>And they went and counseled together with him.<verse eid="1MA 9:59"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:60"/>And he departed to come with a large force and sent letters in secret to all his allies in Judea for them to apprehend Ionathan and those with him, but they were not able, because their plan became known.<verse eid="1MA 9:60"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:61"/>And they apprehended from among the men of the country, who were the leaders of the evil, up to fifty men, and killed them.<verse eid="1MA 9:61"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:62"/>And Ionathan and Simon and those with him withdrew to Baithbasi in the wilderness and rebuilt its ruins and strengthened it.<verse eid="1MA 9:62"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:63"/>And Bacchides learned this, and he gathered together his whole multitude and sent word to those from Judea.<verse eid="1MA 9:63"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:64"/>And he came and camped against Baithbasi, and he battled it for many days and made siege engines.<verse eid="1MA 9:64"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:65"/>And Ionathan left Simon his brother in the city and went out into the country and came with a small number.<verse eid="1MA 9:65"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:66"/>And he defeated Odomera and his brothers and the sons of Phasiron in their covert. And they began to strike and were coming up with the forces.<verse eid="1MA 9:66"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:67"/>And Simon and those with him came out of the city and burned the siege engines.<verse eid="1MA 9:67"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:68"/>And they battled against Bacchides, and he was smashed by them. And they pressed him greatly, because his strategy and his attack were futile.<verse eid="1MA 9:68"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:69"/>And he became enraged with anger at the lawless men who had advised him to come to the country, and they killed many of them and decided to go back to his land.<verse eid="1MA 9:69"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:70"/>And Ionathan learned this, and he sent emissaries to him to conclude peace with him and to give back the captives to them.<verse eid="1MA 9:70"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:71"/>And he accepted and did according to his words, and he swore to him not to seek evil for him all the days of his life.<verse eid="1MA 9:71"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:72"/>And he gave back to him the captives whom he had captured formerly from the land of Iouda, and turning back he returned to his land and did not add to come again to their territory.<verse eid="1MA 9:72"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 9:73"/>And the sword ceased from Israel, and Ionathan lived in Machmas and began to judge the people and removed the impious from Israel.<verse eid="1MA 9:73"/>



  <chapter sid="1MA 10"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:1"/>And in the one hundred sixtieth year, Alexander Epiphanes son of Antiochus went up and took Ptolemais. And they accepted him, and he ruled there.<verse eid="1MA 10:1"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:2"/>And Demetrius the king heard this, and he gathered together very many forces and came out to meet him in battle.<verse eid="1MA 10:2"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:3"/>And Demetrius sent letters to Ionathan with peaceful words in order to magnify him,<verse eid="1MA 10:3"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:4"/>for he said, "Let us move beforehand to make peace with them before he makes peace with Alexander against us.<verse eid="1MA 10:4"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:5"/>For he will remember all the evils which we carried out against him and his brothers and the nation."<verse eid="1MA 10:5"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:6"/>And he gave him authority to muster forces and to prepare weapons and to be his ally; he also said for the hostages in the citadel to be turned over to him.<verse eid="1MA 10:6"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:7"/>And Ionathan came to Ierousalem and read the letters in the hearing of all the people and of those from the citadel.<verse eid="1MA 10:7"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:8"/>And they became very frightened when they heard that the king had given authority to him to muster forces.<verse eid="1MA 10:8"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:9"/>And those from the citadel turned the hostages over to Ionathan, and he gave them back to their parents.<verse eid="1MA 10:9"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:10"/>And Ionathan established his residence in Ierousalem and began to build and renew the city.<verse eid="1MA 10:10"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:11"/>And he said to those who were doing the works to build the walls also around Mount Sion from four-foot stones for fortification, and they did thus.<verse eid="1MA 10:11"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:12"/>And the aliens who were in the fortresses, which Bacchides had built, fled.<verse eid="1MA 10:12"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:13"/>And each one abandoned his place and went back to his own land.<verse eid="1MA 10:13"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:14"/>Only in Baithsoura were some of those left who had abandoned the law and the ordinances, for it became a place of refuge.<verse eid="1MA 10:14"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:15"/>And Alexander the king heard all the offers that Demetrius had sent to Ionathan, and they recounted to him the battles and the heroic acts that he and his brothers had done and the troubles that they had had.<verse eid="1MA 10:15"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:16"/>And he said, "Surely, we shall not find one such man? And now let us make him our Friend and ally."<verse eid="1MA 10:16"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:17"/>And he wrote letters and sent them to him according to these words, saying,<verse eid="1MA 10:17"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:18"/>"King Alexander to his brother Ionathan, greeting.<verse eid="1MA 10:18"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:19"/>We have heard about you, that you are a man powerful in strength and suitable to be our Friend.<verse eid="1MA 10:19"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:20"/>And now we have appointed you today to be high priest of your nation and to be called a Friend of the king"-- and he sent him purple vestments and a golden crown-- "and to think about things as we do and to keep friendship toward us."<verse eid="1MA 10:20"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:21"/>And Ionathan put on the holy vestments in the seventh month of the one hundred sixtieth year at the feast of tent pitching, and he mustered forces and prepared many weapons.<verse eid="1MA 10:21"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:22"/>And Demetrius heard of these developments, and he was grieved and said,<verse eid="1MA 10:22"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:23"/>"What is this that we have done, that Alexander has acted before us to establish friendship with the Judeans for support.<verse eid="1MA 10:23"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:24"/>I also will write them words of invitation and exaltation and gifts so that they may be with me for support."<verse eid="1MA 10:24"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:25"/>And he sent a message to them according to these words, "King Demetrius to the nation of the Judeans, greeting.<verse eid="1MA 10:25"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:26"/>Since you have kept your treaties with us and have remained in our friendship and have not gone over to our enemies, we have heard this and rejoiced.<verse eid="1MA 10:26"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:27"/>And now persist in keeping faith with us, and we will return good things to you in exchange for what you do for us.<verse eid="1MA 10:27"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:28"/>We will grant you many exemptions and will give you gifts.<verse eid="1MA 10:28"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:29"/>"And now I release you and exempt all the Judeans from tribute and from the levy of salt and the crown taxes.<verse eid="1MA 10:29"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:30"/>Also, instead of the third of the grain and the half of the tree fruit which is due for me to receive, I discontinue from today and henceforth collecting them from the land of Iouda and from the three districts annexed to it from Samaritis and Galilee from this very day and for all time.<verse eid="1MA 10:30"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:31"/>And let Ierousalem be holy and exempt, as also its borderlands-- tithes and taxes.<verse eid="1MA 10:31"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:32"/>Furthermore, I release my authority over the citadel in Ierousalem and grant to the high priest to establish in it whatever men he selects to guard it.<verse eid="1MA 10:32"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:33"/>And every soul of the Judeans who was taken hostage from the land of Iouda into all my kingdom I set free without ransom, and let every one exempt them from taxes on their livestock also.<verse eid="1MA 10:33"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:34"/>"And all the feasts and sabbaths and new moons and designated days, and three days before a feast and three after a feast, let all these days be tax-free and exempt for all Judeans who are in my kingdom.<verse eid="1MA 10:34"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:35"/>And no one will have authority to demand payment from or to bother any one of them about any thing.<verse eid="1MA 10:35"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:36"/>"And let some of the Judeans be enrolled in the forces of the king up to thirty thousand men, and provisions will be given to them as is appropriate for all the forces of the king.<verse eid="1MA 10:36"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:37"/>And some of them will be stationed in the large fortresses of the king, and some of these will be assigned to the affairs of the kingdom, which are confidential. And let those who are over them and the rulers be from their own people, and let them follow their laws, as also the king ordered in the land of Iouda.<verse eid="1MA 10:37"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:38"/>"And let the three districts that were annexed to Judea from the country of Samaria be combined with Judea for the purpose of being considered to be under one rule and not to obey any other authority but that of the high priest.<verse eid="1MA 10:38"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:39"/>Ptolemais and the land belonging to it I have given as a gift to the holy places<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">10:39</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'holy places':  I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 10:40"/>Furthermore, I will give every year fifteen thousand shekels of silver out of the accounts of the king from the places belonging to him.<verse eid="1MA 10:40"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:41"/>And all the excess that they did not pay out from the revenues, as they did among the first nations, from now on they shall give for the works of the house<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">10:41</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 10:42"/>And in addition to this, five thousand shekels of silver, as much as they received from the revenues of the holy place out of the account every year, these also are remitted, because they belong to the priests who are ministering.<verse eid="1MA 10:42"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:43"/>And all who take refuge in the temple in Ierousalem and in all its areas, because they are in debt to the king or for any other reason, let them and everything that is theirs be set free in my kingdom.<verse eid="1MA 10:43"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 10:46"/>But when Ionathan and the people heard these words, they did not believe them nor accept them, because they remembered the great evil that he did in Israel and how he oppressed them greatly.<verse eid="1MA 10:46"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:47"/>And they preferred Alexander, because it was he who began to speak to them with peaceful words, and they allied themselves with him all his days.<verse eid="1MA 10:47"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:48"/>And Alexander the king gathered together large forces and camped opposite Demetrius.<verse eid="1MA 10:48"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:49"/>And the two kings joined in battle, and the army of Demetrius fled, and Alexander pursued him, and he prevailed over them.<verse eid="1MA 10:49"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:50"/>And he sustained the battle forcefully until the sun set, and Demetrius fell on that day.<verse eid="1MA 10:50"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:51"/>And Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemy, king of Egypt, with these words, saying,<verse eid="1MA 10:51"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:52"/>"Whereas I have returned to my kingdom and have sat on the throne of my fathers and have taken hold of the government and have crushed Demetrius and have taken control of our land,<verse eid="1MA 10:52"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:53"/>and I joined battle with him, and he and his army were smashed by us, and we have sat on the throne of his kingdom,<verse eid="1MA 10:53"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:54"/>And now let us establish friendship with each other, and now give me your daughter as a wife, and I will become your son-in-law and will give gifts to you and to her, which are worthy of you."<verse eid="1MA 10:54"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:55"/>And Ptolemy the king answered, saying, "It was a good day on which you returned to the land of your fathers and sat on the throne of their kingdom.<verse eid="1MA 10:55"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:56"/>And now I will do for you what you wrote, but meet me in Ptolemais so that we may see each other, and I will become your father-in-law as you have said."<verse eid="1MA 10:56"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:57"/>And Ptolemy came out of Egypt, he and his daughter, and came to Ptolemais in the one hundred sixty-second year.<verse eid="1MA 10:57"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:58"/>And Alexander the king met him, and he gave him Cleopatra his daughter and held her wedding in Ptolemais as kings with great pomp.<verse eid="1MA 10:58"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:59"/>And Alexander the king wrote to Ionathan to come to a meeting with him,<verse eid="1MA 10:59"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:60"/>and he came with pomp to Ptolemais and met with the two kings, and he gave silver and gold to them and to their Friends and many gifts, and he found favor before them.<verse eid="1MA 10:60"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:61"/>And some corrupt men from Israel gathered together against him, lawless men, to petition against him, but the king did not pay attention to them.<verse eid="1MA 10:61"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:62"/>And the king gave orders, and they removed Ionathan's garments from him and clothed him in purple, and they did thus.<verse eid="1MA 10:62"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:63"/>And the king seated him with himself and said to his rulers, "Go out with him to the middle of the city, and announce that no one is to petition against him concerning any thing, and let no one bother him for any reason."<verse eid="1MA 10:63"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:64"/>And it happened as the petitioners saw his prestige, as he had announced it, and saw him clothed in purple, they all fled.<verse eid="1MA 10:64"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:65"/>And the king honored him and listed him among his First Friends and made him general and provincial governor.<verse eid="1MA 10:65"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:66"/>And Ionathan returned to Ierousalem with peace and gladness.<verse eid="1MA 10:66"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:67"/>And in the one hundred sixty-fifth year Demetrius son of Demetrius came from Crete to the land of his fathers.<verse eid="1MA 10:67"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:68"/>And Alexander the king learned this, and he was greatly grieved and returned to Antioch.<verse eid="1MA 10:68"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:69"/>And Demetrius appointed Apollonius, who was over Coele-Syria, and he gathered a large force and camped in Jamnia. And he sent a message to Ionathan the high priest saying,<verse eid="1MA 10:69"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:70"/>"You alone rise up against us, and I have become an object of ridicule and derision because of you. And why do you have authority over us in the mountains?<verse eid="1MA 10:70"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:71"/>Now then, if you are confident in your forces, come down to us on the plain, and let us measure ourselves with each other there, because with me is the army of the cities.<verse eid="1MA 10:71"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:72"/>Ask, and learn who I am and who the rest are who are helping us. And they say, 'You are not able to stand against us, because twice your fathers were routed in their land.'<verse eid="1MA 10:72"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:73"/>And now you will not be able to withstand the cavalry and so much force on the plain where there is no stone or rock, nor any place to flee."<verse eid="1MA 10:73"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:74"/>But when Ionathan heard the words of Apollonius, he was moved in thought. And he selected ten thousand men and came out of Ierousalem, and Simon his brother met him to help him.<verse eid="1MA 10:74"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:75"/>And he camped at Joppe, but those from the city closed him out, because there was a garrison of Apollonius in Joppe, and they made war against it,<verse eid="1MA 10:75"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:76"/>and those in the city became afraid and opened it, and Ionathan took control of Joppe.<verse eid="1MA 10:76"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:77"/>And Apollonius heard this, and he marshaled three thousand cavalry and a large force and went to Azotus as if he were passing through. And simultaneously he advanced to the plain, because he had a multitude of cavalry and trusted in it.<verse eid="1MA 10:77"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:78"/>And he<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">10:78</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'Ionathan'</char></note> chased after him into Azotus, and the two armies joined in battle.<verse eid="1MA 10:78"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:79"/>But Apollonius secretly left a thousand cavalry behind them.<verse eid="1MA 10:79"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:80"/>And Ionathan understood that there was an ambush behind him, and they surrounded his army and shot arrows at the people from morning until the afternoon.<verse eid="1MA 10:80"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:81"/>But the people stood, as Ionathan had ordered, and the enemy cavalry grew tired.<verse eid="1MA 10:81"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:82"/>And Simon drew in his force and joined battle with the phalanx, for the cavalry had broken up, and they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">10:82</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the phalanx'</char></note> were smashed by him and fled.<verse eid="1MA 10:82"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:83"/>And the cavalry was scattered in the plain, and they fled to Azotus and entered Bethdagon, the house of their idol, to be saved.<verse eid="1MA 10:83"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:84"/>And Ionathan burned Azotus and the cities surrounding it and took their spoils, and the temple of Dagon, and those who had taken refuge in it he burned with fire.<verse eid="1MA 10:84"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:85"/>And those who fell by the dagger, together with those who were burned, were about eight thousand men.<verse eid="1MA 10:85"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:86"/>And Ionathan departed from there and camped against Ascalon, and the people from the city came out to meet him with great pomp.<verse eid="1MA 10:86"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:87"/>And Ionathan returned to Ierousalem with those who were with him having many spoils.<verse eid="1MA 10:87"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:88"/>And it happened, when Alexander the king heard of these developments, he even added to honor Ionathan,<verse eid="1MA 10:88"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 10:89"/>and he sent him a golden brooch, as is the custom, to be given to the Kinsmen of kings. And he gave him Akkaron and all its regions as his dependency.<verse eid="1MA 10:89"/>



  <chapter sid="1MA 11"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:1"/>And the king of Egypt assembled many forces, like the sand that is at the edge of the sea, and many ships and sought to take control of the kingdom of Alexander by deceit and to add it to his own kingdom.<verse eid="1MA 11:1"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:2"/>And he set out for Syria with peaceful words, and the people from the cities opened to him and met him, because it was the command of Alexander the king to meet him, because he was his father-in-law.<verse eid="1MA 11:2"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:3"/>But as he entered into the cities, Ptolemy stationed forces as a guard in each city.<verse eid="1MA 11:3"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:4"/>When he drew near to Azotus, they showed him the burnt temple of Dagon and Azotus and its outskirts in ruins and bodies scattered around and the burned corpses which he<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">11:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 11:5"/>And they recounted to the king the things that Ionathan had done in order to blame him, but the king kept silent.<verse eid="1MA 11:5"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:6"/>And Ionathan met the king at Joppe with pomp, and they greeted each other and slept there.<verse eid="1MA 11:6"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:7"/>And Ionathan went with the king as far as the river called Eleutherus, and he returned to Ierousalem.<verse eid="1MA 11:7"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:8"/>But King Ptolemy took control of the cities on the coast as far as Seleuceia by the sea, and he was contemplating evil thoughts about Alexander.<verse eid="1MA 11:8"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:9"/>And he sent ambassadors to Demetrius the king, saying, "Come, let us conclude an agreement between ourselves, and I will give you my daughter, whom Alexander has, and you will rule over the kingdom of your father.<verse eid="1MA 11:9"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:10"/>For I have changed my mind about giving my daughter to him, because he has sought to kill me."<verse eid="1MA 11:10"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:11"/>And he blamed him, because he desired his kingdom.<verse eid="1MA 11:11"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:12"/>And he took his daughter away and gave her to Demetrius, and he became alienated from Alexander, and their hostility became apparent.<verse eid="1MA 11:12"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:13"/>And Ptolemy entered Antioch and put on the crown of Asia, and he placed two crowns on his head, that of Egypt and of Asia.<verse eid="1MA 11:13"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:14"/>But Alexander the king was in Cilicia during those times, because the people from those places were rebelling.<verse eid="1MA 11:14"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:15"/>And Alexander heard of this, and he came against him in battle. And Ptolemy marched out and met him with a strong troop and routed him.<verse eid="1MA 11:15"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:16"/>And Alexander fled to Arabia to hide himself there, and King Ptolemy was exalted.<verse eid="1MA 11:16"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:17"/>And Zabdiel the Arab cut off the head of Alexander and sent it to Ptolemy.<verse eid="1MA 11:17"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:18"/>But King Ptolemy died on the third day, and his men who were in his fortresses were destroyed by the people in the fortresses.<verse eid="1MA 11:18"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:19"/>And Demetrius became king in the one hundred sixty-seventh year.<verse eid="1MA 11:19"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:20"/>In those days Ionathan gathered together men from Judea to assault the citadel in Ierousalem, and they made many siege engines against it.<verse eid="1MA 11:20"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:21"/>But certain people who hated their nation, lawless men, went to the king and reported to him that Ionathan was besieging the citadel.<verse eid="1MA 11:21"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:22"/>And when he heard this he became angry, and as soon as he heard it, he marched immediately and came to Ptolemais, and he wrote Ionathan not to besiege the citadel and to present himself to him for a meeting in Ptolemais most speedily.<verse eid="1MA 11:22"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:23"/>But when Ionathan heard this, he directed that the siege continue, and he selected some of the elders of Israel and some of the priests and put himself in danger.<verse eid="1MA 11:23"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:24"/>And taking silver, gold and clothing and many other gifts, he went to the king in Ptolemais and found favor before him.<verse eid="1MA 11:24"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:25"/>And certain lawless men from his nation petitioned against him,<verse eid="1MA 11:25"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:26"/>but the king did to him as his predecessors did to him before him and exalted him before all his Friends.<verse eid="1MA 11:26"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:27"/>And he bestowed upon him the high priesthood and as many other honors as he had before and made him be counted among his First Friends.<verse eid="1MA 11:27"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:28"/>And Ionathan requested that the king make Judea tax-free, as well as the three districts and Samaritis, and pledged to him three hundred talents.<verse eid="1MA 11:28"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:29"/>And the king was pleased and wrote letters to Ionathan concerning all these things in this way:<verse eid="1MA 11:29"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 11:34"/>We have guaranteed for them the boundaries of Judea as well as the three districts of Aphairema and Lydda and Ramathaim; these were added to Judea from Samaritis, with all the areas belonging to them, for all those who sacrifice in Ierousalem in exchange for the royal taxes that the king received from them formerly every year from the produce of the earth and from the tree fruits.<verse eid="1MA 11:34"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:35"/>And the other revenues belonging to us from the present time, from the tithes and the taxes that belong to us, and the lakes of salt and the crown taxes that belong to us, all these we will excuse for them.<verse eid="1MA 11:35"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 11:38"/>And Demetrius the king saw that the land became quiet before him, and no one opposed him, and he dismissed all his forces, each one to his own place, except for the foreign forces whom he had enlisted from the islands of the nations. But all the forces that had served under his fathers were hostile to him.<verse eid="1MA 11:38"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:39"/>And Trypho was one of those who were with Alexander formerly, and he saw that all the forces were complaining against Demetrius, and he went to Imalkoue the Arab, who was raising Antiochus, the small son of Alexander,<verse eid="1MA 11:39"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:40"/>and was watching over him until he could hand him over to him so that he could rule in his father's place. And he reported to him all that Demetrius had accomplished and the hostility that his forces showed toward him, and he remained there many days.<verse eid="1MA 11:40"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:41"/>And Ionathan sent a message to Demetrius the king to remove the soldiers of the citadel from Ierousalem, and the soldiers in the fortresses, for they were battling Israel.<verse eid="1MA 11:41"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:42"/>And Demetrius sent a message to Ionathan, saying, "Not only will I do these things to you and to your nation, but I will glorify you and your nation greatly, if I have the opportunity.<verse eid="1MA 11:42"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:43"/>Now then, you will do right to send men to me who will ally themselves with me, because all my forces have revolted."<verse eid="1MA 11:43"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:44"/>And Ionathan sent three thousand men powerful in strength to him in Antioch, and they came to the king, and the king rejoiced at their arrival.<verse eid="1MA 11:44"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:45"/>And the people from the city gathered together in the middle of the city up to one hundred and twenty thousand men, and they wanted to kill the king.<verse eid="1MA 11:45"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:46"/>But the king fled into the court. And the people of the city seized the thoroughfares of the city and began to fight.<verse eid="1MA 11:46"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:47"/>And the king called the Judeans for help, and they all together came to him and scattered throughout the city and killed on that day up to a hundred thousand.<verse eid="1MA 11:47"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:48"/>And they burned the city and took many spoils on that day and saved the king.<verse eid="1MA 11:48"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:49"/>And the people of the city saw that the Judeans had taken control of the city as they wanted, and they became weakened in their spirit and called out to the king with supplication, saying,<verse eid="1MA 11:49"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:50"/>"Make a treaty with us, and let the Judeans stop fighting us and the city."<verse eid="1MA 11:50"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:51"/>And they threw down their weapons and made peace. And the Judeans were glorified before the king and before all those in his kingdom. And they became renowned in his kingdom and returned to Ierousalem having many spoils.<verse eid="1MA 11:51"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:52"/>And Demetrius the king sat upon the throne of his kingdom, and the land became quiet before him.<verse eid="1MA 11:52"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:53"/>But he falsified everything he had said and became alienated from Ionathan and did not return the favors that he<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">11:53</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 11:54"/>Now after these things Trypho returned, and with him Antiochus, a rather young boy, and he became king and put on a crown.<verse eid="1MA 11:54"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:55"/>And all the forces that Demetrius had cast off gathered together and fought against him, and he fled and was routed.<verse eid="1MA 11:55"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:56"/>Trypho took the beasts and took control of Antioch.<verse eid="1MA 11:56"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:57"/>And Antiochus the younger wrote to Ionathan saying, "I bestow upon you the high priesthood and establish you over the four districts and to be among the Friends of the king."<verse eid="1MA 11:57"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:58"/>And he sent him gold plate and table utensils, and he gave him the authority to drink from gold goblets and to be clothed in purple and to have a gold brooch.<verse eid="1MA 11:58"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:59"/>And he established Simon his brother commander from the ascent of Tyre as far as the borders of Egypt.<verse eid="1MA 11:59"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:60"/>And Ionathan went out and crossed over beyond the river and among the cities, and the whole force of Syria gathered to him in alliance. And he came to Ascalon, and the people of the city met him with pomp.<verse eid="1MA 11:60"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:61"/>And he went from there to Gaza, but the people of Gaza closed him out.

    <verse sid="1MA 11:62"/>And the people of Gaza appealed to Ionathan, and he made a treaty with them and took the sons of their rulers as hostages and sent them to Ierousalem. And he went through the country as far as Damascus.<verse eid="1MA 11:62"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:63"/>And Ionathan heard that the commanders of Demetrius had arrived in Kedes in Galilee with a large force desiring to remove him from his position.<verse eid="1MA 11:63"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:64"/>And he met with them but left his brother Simon in the country.<verse eid="1MA 11:64"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:65"/>And Simon camped against Baithsoura and fought it for many days and shut them in.<verse eid="1MA 11:65"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:66"/>And they appealed to him to make a treaty, and he made one with him, and he removed them from there and took control of the city and put a garrison in it.<verse eid="1MA 11:66"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:67"/>And Ionathan and his army camped at the water of Gennesar. And early in the morning they went to the plain of Hasor,<verse eid="1MA 11:67"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:68"/>and look, an army of the allophyles met him in the plain. And they laid an ambush for him in the mountains, but they met him face to face.<verse eid="1MA 11:68"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:69"/>Now those who were in the ambush came out of their hiding places and joined battle.<verse eid="1MA 11:69"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:70"/>And all those with Ionathan fled; not one of them was left except Mattathias the son of Absalomos and Ioudas the son of Chalphi, commanders of the army of the forces.<verse eid="1MA 11:70"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:71"/>And Ionathan tore his clothes and put dirt on his head and prayed.<verse eid="1MA 11:71"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:72"/>And he turned around towards them in battle and routed them, and they fled.<verse eid="1MA 11:72"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:73"/>And his own men, who were fleeing, saw this, and they returned to him and pursued them with him as far as Kedes, as far as their camp, and they encamped there.<verse eid="1MA 11:73"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 11:74"/>And on that day up to three thousand men of the allophyles fell, and Ionathan returned to Ierousalem.<verse eid="1MA 11:74"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 12:1"/>And Ionathan saw that the time was opportune for him, and he selected men and sent them to Rome to affirm and to renew the friendship with them.<verse eid="1MA 12:1"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:2"/>And to the Spartans and other places he sent letters for the same purpose.<verse eid="1MA 12:2"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:3"/>And they went to Rome and entered the council chamber and said, "Ionathan the high priest and the nation of the Judeans sent us to renew friendship with them and the alliance as before."<verse eid="1MA 12:3"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 12:5"/>And this is a copy of the letters that Ionathan wrote to the Spartans:<verse eid="1MA 12:5"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 12:24"/>And Ionathan heard that the commanders of Demetrius had returned with a large force, more than before, to fight against him,<verse eid="1MA 12:24"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 12:26"/>And he sent spies into their camp, and they returned and informed him that they were marshalling troops to fall upon them by night.<verse eid="1MA 12:26"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:27"/>So as the sun was setting, Ionathan gave orders to those with him to be vigilant and to be ready for battle with their weapons through the whole night, and he posted advanced guards around the camp.<verse eid="1MA 12:27"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 12:30"/>And Ionathan chased after them but did not catch them, for they had crossed the Eleutherus river.<verse eid="1MA 12:30"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:31"/>And Ionathan turned aside to the Arabs, who are called Zabadeans, and defeated them and took their spoils.<verse eid="1MA 12:31"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:32"/>And he set out and went to Damascus and passed through all that country.<verse eid="1MA 12:32"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:33"/>And Simon also went out and passed through as far as Ascalon and the fortresses close by. And he turned aside to Joppe and occupied it,<verse eid="1MA 12:33"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 12:35"/>And Ionathan returned and assembled the elders of the people and took counsel with them to build fortresses in Judea<verse eid="1MA 12:35"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:36"/>and to elevate the walls of Ierousalem and to raise up a high wall between the citadel and the city, to separate it from the city in order that it could be isolated so that they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">12:36</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 12:40"/>But he was afraid, lest Ionathan not allow him and lest he fight against them, and he sought a way to apprehend and destroy him, and he departed and came to Baithsan.<verse eid="1MA 12:40"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:41"/>And Ionathan came out to meet him with forty thousand selected men in battle order, and he came to Baithsan.<verse eid="1MA 12:41"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:42"/>And Trypho saw that he had come with a large force, and he was afraid to stretch out his hand against him.<verse eid="1MA 12:42"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:43"/>And he received him with honor and introduced him to all his Friends and gave him gifts and gave orders to his Friends and to his forces to obey him as they would himself.<verse eid="1MA 12:43"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 12:45"/>And now send them to their homes and select for yourself a few men who will be with you and come with me to Ptolemais, and I will turn it over to you, and the other fortresses and the other forces and all those in the royal service, and I will turn and leave.

    <verse sid="1MA 12:47"/>And he left with himself three thousand men of whom he left two thousand in Galilee, and one thousand went with him.<verse eid="1MA 12:47"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:48"/>But when Ionathan entered into Ptolemais, the people of Ptolemais shut the gates and apprehended him, and all those who entered with him they killed by the sword.<verse eid="1MA 12:48"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:49"/>And Trypho sent infantry and cavalry to Galilee and the great plain to destroy all those who were with Ionathan.<verse eid="1MA 12:49"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 12:50"/>But they knew that he had been apprehended and destroyed together with those who were with him, and they encouraged themselves and marched close together ready for battle.<verse eid="1MA 12:50"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 13:1"/>And Simon heard that Trypho gathered together a large force to come into the land of Iouda and to devastate it,<verse eid="1MA 13:1"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 13:3"/>And he encouraged them and said to them, "You yourselves know all that I and my brothers and the house of my father have done for the laws and the holy places<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">13:3</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'holy places':  I.e.

    <verse sid="1MA 13:13"/>But Simon camped in Adida facing the plain.<verse eid="1MA 13:13"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 13:14"/>And Trypho learned that Simon had risen up in place of Ionathan his brother and that he was about to join battle with him, and he sent ambassadors to him, saying,<verse eid="1MA 13:14"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 13:17"/>And Simon knew that they were speaking to him with deceit, and he sent for the silver and the boys so as not to raise great animosity in the people,<verse eid="1MA 13:17"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 13:18"/>who would say, "Because I did not send the silver and the boys to him he<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">13:18</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'Ionathan'</char></note> perished."<verse eid="1MA 13:18"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 13:21"/>But the men in the citadel were sending envoys to Trypho urging him to come to them through the wilderness and to send food to them.<verse eid="1MA 13:21"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 13:22"/>And Trypho prepared all his cavalry to go, but on that night there was very much snow, and he did not go because of the snow. And he departed and went to Galaaditis.<verse eid="1MA 13:22"/>
    <verse sid="1MA 13:23"/>But as he drew near to Baskama, he killed Ionathan, and he was buried there.<verse eid="1MA 13:23"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 13:30"/>This tomb, which he made in Modein, remains to this day.<verse eid="1MA 13:30"/>

    <verse sid="1MA 13:33"/>And Simon built the fortresses of Judea and walled them around with high towers and great walls and gates and bolts, and he put food in the fortresses.<verse eid="1MA 13:33"/>
