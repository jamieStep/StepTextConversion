  <chapter sid="LJE 1"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:1"/>A copy of a letter that Ieremias sent to those who would be led as captives into Babylon by the king of the Babylonians to proclaim to them just as it was commanded to him by God. On account of the sins that you have sinned against God, you will be led into Babylon as captives by Nabouchodonosor, king of the Babylonians.<verse eid="LJE 1:1"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:2"/>When, therefore, you come into Babylon, you will be there for rather many years, even for a long time, as long as seven generations. But after this, I will bring you from there with peace.<verse eid="LJE 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:3"/>Now then, you will see in Babylon silver and gold and wooden gods being carried upon shoulders causing fear to the nations.<verse eid="LJE 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:4"/>Beware, therefore, lest you too, having been made like the allophyles, become like<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'become like':  I.e. 'are assimilated to'</char></note> them and reverence for them<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note> seizes you<verse eid="LJE 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:5"/>when you see a crowd before and behind them doing obeisance to them, but say in thought, "It is necessary to bow down to you, O Master."<verse eid="LJE 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:6"/>For my angel<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'messenger'</char></note> is with you, and he himself is seeking out your souls.<verse eid="LJE 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:7"/>For their tongue has been smoothed by a craftsman, and they are overlaid with gold and silver. Yet they are fake and are not able to speak.<verse eid="LJE 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:8"/>And just as for a maiden who loves ornamentation, taking gold,<verse eid="LJE 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:9"/>they construct crowns upon the heads of their gods. But it is also the case that the priests, purloining gold and silver from their gods, will spend it on themselves.<verse eid="LJE 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:10"/>And they will give of them also to the prostitutes at the brothel. And they adorn them<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:10</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note> with clothes like human beings-- gods of silver and gold and wood.<verse eid="LJE 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:11"/>But they are not kept safe from rust and food<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'corrosion'</char></note>. When they are dressed in purple clothing,<verse eid="LJE 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:12"/>they have their face wiped because of the dust from the house, which is rather much upon them.<verse eid="LJE 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:13"/>And he<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the god'</char></note> has a scepter like a human district judge, he<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the god'</char></note> who will not destroy the one who sins against him.<verse eid="LJE 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:14"/>And he has a hand-knife in his right and an ax but will not deliver himself from war and robbers. Whence they are recognizable as not being gods. Do not, therefore, fear them.<verse eid="LJE 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:15"/>For just as when a person's implement, when broken, becomes useless,<verse eid="LJE 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:16"/>such are their gods, though they are established in houses. Their eyes are full of dust from the feet of those who enter.<verse eid="LJE 1:16"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:17"/>And just as the courtyards are fortified all around against anyone who has wronged the king as though sentenced to death, the priests secure their houses with doorways and bolts and bars, lest they be stripped by robbers.<verse eid="LJE 1:17"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:18"/>They burn lamps even more than for themselves, none of which they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:18</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note> can see.<verse eid="LJE 1:18"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:19"/>Just like one of the beams of the house they are, and they do not notice that their hearts, it is said, are licked out, as the creeping creatures from the earth devour both them and their clothing,<verse eid="LJE 1:19"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:20"/>blackened in their face by the smoke from the house.<verse eid="LJE 1:20"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:21"/>Bats, swallows and birds ride upon their bodies and their heads, just as also the cats do.<verse eid="LJE 1:21"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:22"/>Whence you will know that they are not gods. Do not, therefore, fear them.<verse eid="LJE 1:22"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:23"/>For the gold, which they wear for beauty, unless someone wipes off the corrosion, they will not make it shine, for they were not sentient, even when they were cast.<verse eid="LJE 1:23"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:24"/>Those things in which there is no breath are bought at all cost.<verse eid="LJE 1:24"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:25"/>Lacking feet they are carried upon shoulders displaying their dishonor to people, and even those who attend to them are ashamed<verse eid="LJE 1:25"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:26"/>on account of the fact that they are made to stand up by them, lest it<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:26</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the god'</char></note> fall to the ground. Not even if some one makes it stand upright, will it move by itself, nor if it leans over, will it straighten itself up, but gifts are placed before them, just as before the dead.<verse eid="LJE 1:26"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:27"/>But their priests, by selling their sacrifices, use them<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:27</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note>. And likewise also their wives preserve some of them<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:27</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the sacrifices'</char></note>, but they do not share any with the poor or disabled.<verse eid="LJE 1:27"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:28"/>One who sits apart<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:28</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'sits apart':  I.e. 'is menstruating'</char></note> and one who has just given birth touch their sacrifices. Since you know, therefore, from these things that they are not gods, do not fear them.<verse eid="LJE 1:28"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:29"/>For on what basis can they be called gods? Because women serve up for gods of silver and gold and wood!<verse eid="LJE 1:29"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:30"/>in their houses the priests take their seat with their tunics torn and their heads and beards shaved, whose heads are uncovered.<verse eid="LJE 1:30"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:31"/>And they howl and shout before their gods as some do at a funeral feast for a corpse.<verse eid="LJE 1:31"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:32"/>Taking from their<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:32</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note> clothing, the priests clothe their wives and children.<verse eid="LJE 1:32"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:33"/>Whether they experience evil from someone, or whether it be good, they will not be able to repay. They can neither empower a king nor can they remove him.<verse eid="LJE 1:33"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:34"/>Likewise they can neither give wealth nor money<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:34</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'copper'</char></note>. If anyone, professing a vow to them, does not keep it, they will not demand it.<verse eid="LJE 1:34"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:35"/>They will not deliver a person from death nor rescue a weak person from a strong one.<verse eid="LJE 1:35"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:36"/>They will not restore a blind person to sight; they will not rescue a person who is in anguish.<verse eid="LJE 1:36"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:37"/>They will not have pity on a widow nor treat an orphan well.<verse eid="LJE 1:37"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:38"/>These things that are made of wood and overlaid with gold and silver are like stones from a mountain, and those who attend to them will be put to shame.<verse eid="LJE 1:38"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:39"/>Why then should they be thought to be or be called gods?<verse eid="LJE 1:39"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:40"/>Furthermore, though the Chaldeans themselves bring them into disrespect-- when they see a mute incapable of speech, bring him and request that Bel utter an articulate sound, as though he<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:40</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'Bel'</char></note> were capable of sensation--<verse eid="LJE 1:40"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:41"/>they are incapable of abandoning them<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:41</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note>, though they themselves have observed it. For they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:41</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.'the Chaldeans'</char></note> have no sense.<verse eid="LJE 1:41"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:42"/>And the women, wrapping cords around themselves, sit in the streets burning bran as incense!<verse eid="LJE 1:42"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:43"/>And when one of them is drawn away by one of those who passes by to have sexual intercourse, she chides her companion, because she was not valued as she herself was, nor has she had her cord<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:43</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'for tying her clothes'</char></note> torn.<verse eid="LJE 1:43"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:44"/>Everything that happens for them<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:44</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note> is fake. How then should one consider or call them gods?<verse eid="LJE 1:44"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:45"/>They have been constructed by carpenters and goldsmiths; they are nothing other than what the artisans want them to be.<verse eid="LJE 1:45"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:46"/>And they who construct them will not themselves be long-lived.<verse eid="LJE 1:46"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:47"/>How then indeed are the things made by them going to be gods? For they have left behind lies and disgrace for those who come after.<verse eid="LJE 1:47"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:48"/>For when war or evils come upon them, the priests take counsel with themselves about where to hide with them<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:48</char><char closed="false" style="ft">', the priests take counsel with themselves about where to hide with them':  I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note>.<verse eid="LJE 1:48"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:49"/>How then can one not perceive that they are not gods, who save themselves neither from war nor from calamities?<verse eid="LJE 1:49"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:50"/>For being wood and overlaid with gold and silver, it will be known thereafter that they are fake; it will be clear to all nations and kings that they are not gods but the works of human hands and that there is no divine work in them.<verse eid="LJE 1:50"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:51"/>By whom then should it not be known that they are not gods?<verse eid="LJE 1:51"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:52"/>For they will not set up a king of a country, nor will they give rain to people.<verse eid="LJE 1:52"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:53"/>And they will not decide their own case or deliver one who is wronged, since they are powerless.<verse eid="LJE 1:53"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:54"/>For like crows between heaven and earth they are. For also when fire attacks a house of gods who are wooden or overlaid with gold or silver, their priests flee and will come through safely, but they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:54</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note> will be burned up like the center beams.<verse eid="LJE 1:54"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:55"/>And they shall not withstand king or enemies.<verse eid="LJE 1:55"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:56"/>How then must it be admitted or reckoned that they are gods? Gods made of wood and overlaid with silver and gold will not be safe either from thieves or from bandits,<verse eid="LJE 1:56"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:57"/>the strong of whom will strip away the gold and silver, and they make off with the clothing they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:57</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note> wear. Nor shall they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:57</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note> help themselves.<verse eid="LJE 1:57"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:58"/>So it is better to be a king who displays his manliness or a useful vessel in a house, which the owner will use, than these fake gods, or even a door in a house that keeps safe those things that are in it than these fake gods, and a wooden pillar in palaces than these fake gods.<verse eid="LJE 1:58"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:59"/>For sun and moon and stars are bright, and when they are sent for a service, they are obedient.<verse eid="LJE 1:59"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:60"/>So also lightning, when it flashes, is conspicuous. And the same wind also blows in every country.<verse eid="LJE 1:60"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:61"/>And as for clouds, when ordered by God to traverse the entire inhabited world, they accomplish what is ordained.<verse eid="LJE 1:61"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:62"/>And the fire sent out from above to destroy utterly mountains and woods will do what is prescribed. But these things<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:62</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the gods(') '</char></note> are similar neither in appearances nor in powers.<verse eid="LJE 1:62"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:63"/>Whence one should neither think them to be nor call them gods, since they are not able either to judge a case or to treat humans well.<verse eid="LJE 1:63"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:64"/>Since you know, therefore, that they are not gods, do not fear them.<verse eid="LJE 1:64"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:65"/>For they cannot curse or bless kings,<verse eid="LJE 1:65"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:66"/>and they cannot show signs in heaven among the nations or shine like the sun or give light like the moon.<verse eid="LJE 1:66"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:67"/>The animals, which, fleeing to shelter, are able to help themselves, are superior to them.<verse eid="LJE 1:67"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:68"/>It is clear to us that they are in no manner gods. Therefore do not fear them.<verse eid="LJE 1:68"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:69"/>For as a scarecrow in a cucumber field guards nothing, so are their gods of wood and gold and silver overlay.<verse eid="LJE 1:69"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:70"/>In the same way also their gods of wood and overlaid with gold and silver are similar to a thorn bush in a garden on which every bird perches, and so also to a corpse thrown out in darkness.<verse eid="LJE 1:70"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:71"/>And from the purple and marble<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:71</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'sparkling cloth'</char></note> that rots upon them you will know that they are not gods. And finally they will themselves be consumed, and there will be disgrace in the country.<verse eid="LJE 1:71"/>
    <verse sid="LJE 1:72"/>Better, therefore, is a righteous person who does not have idols, for he will be far from reproach.<verse eid="LJE 1:72"/>
