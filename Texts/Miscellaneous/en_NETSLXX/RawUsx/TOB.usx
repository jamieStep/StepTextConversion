    <verse sid="TOB 1:2"/>who in the days of Enemessaros, the king of the Assyrians, was taken into captivity from Thisbe which is to the right<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Aramaic/Hebrew = 'south'</char></note> of Kydios Nephthaleim in Upper Galilee, above Asser<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">+ Göttingen Ed. = 'the road'</char></note> to the west, left<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Aramaic/Hebrew = 'north'</char></note> of Phogor.<verse eid="TOB 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:3"/>I, Tobith, walked in the ways of truth and in righteous acts all the days of my life, and I performed many acts of charity for my kindred and my people who had gone with me in exile into the land of the Assyrians, into Nineue.<verse eid="TOB 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:4"/>And when I was in my own country, in the land of Israel, and when I was young, all the tribe of Nephthaleim my ancestor withdrew from the house of Dauid my ancestor and from Ierousalem, the city chosen from all the tribes of Israel to offer sacrifice for all the tribes of Israel, and the shrine of God's covert had been consecrated and established in it for all the generations of the age.<verse eid="TOB 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:5"/>All my kindred and the house of Nephthaleim my ancestor sacrificed to the calf which Ierobeam, the king of Israel, had made in Dan on all the mountains of Galilee.<verse eid="TOB 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:6"/>But I all alone went frequently into Hierosolyma for the feasts, as it is written in all Israel in an everlasting ordinance. Taking the first fruits and the first products and the tithes of the cattle and the first shearings of the sheep, I would hurry off to Hierosolyma.<verse eid="TOB 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:7"/>And I gave these to the priests, the sons of Aaron, at the altar, and the tenth of the grain and the wine and olive oil and pomegranates and the figs and the rest of the fruits to the sons of Leui who ministered in Ierousalem. Also I tithed the second tenth in silver for six years and would go and spend these things in Ierousalem each year.<verse eid="TOB 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:8"/>And I gave these things to the orphans and the widows and guests who had attached themselves to the sons of Israel. I brought and gave these things to them in the third year, and we would eat them according to the decree that had been decreed concerning them in the law of Moyses and according to the commands which Debbora, the mother of Hananiel our father, had commanded, for my father had left me an orphan and died.<verse eid="TOB 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:9"/>And when I became a man, I took a wife, one of our own family, and by her I became the father of a son, and I called his name Tobias.<verse eid="TOB 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:10"/>After I was taken captive to the Assyrians and when I was taken captive, I went into Nineue. And all of my kindred and my race ate the food of the nations,<verse eid="TOB 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:11"/>but I kept myself from eating the bread of the nations.<verse eid="TOB 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:12"/>And when I was mindful of my God with my whole soul,<verse eid="TOB 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:13"/>the Most High gave me favor and good standing with Enemessaros, and I bought everything he needed.<verse eid="TOB 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:14"/>So I would go into Media and buy for him there until he died. And I placed in trust bags of silver, ten talents worth, with Gabaelos the brother of Gabri in the country of Media.<verse eid="TOB 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:15"/>But when Enemassar died and Sennachereim his son became king in his place, then the roads to Media became unfit, and I could no longer go into Media.<verse eid="TOB 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:16"/>In the days of Enemessaros I performed many acts of charity for my kindred, those of my race.<verse eid="TOB 1:16"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:17"/>I would give my bread to the hungry and clothing to the naked, and if I saw anyone of my people dead and cast out behind the wall of Nineue, I would bury him.<verse eid="TOB 1:17"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:18"/>And if Sennachereim killed anyone, when he came fleeing from Judea in the days of judgment which the king of heaven executed upon him because of the blasphemies which he blasphemed, I buried him. For in his anger he killed many of the sons of Israel, but I would steal their bodies and bury them. And Sennachereim sought them, but he could not find them.<verse eid="TOB 1:18"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:19"/>Then a certain one of the people of Nineue went and informed the king about me, that I bury them; so I hid myself. But when I discovered that the king knew about me and that I was being sought out to be put to death, I was afraid and ran away.<verse eid="TOB 1:19"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:20"/>Then everything that belonged to me was seized, and nothing was left to me that was not taken into the royal treasury, except Hanna my wife and Tobias my son.<verse eid="TOB 1:20"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:21"/>But forty days did not pass before two of his sons killed him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararat. Then Sacherdonos his son became king after him. And he appointed Achicharos son of Hanael my brother over all the accounts of his kingdom, and he had authority over all the administration.<verse eid="TOB 1:21"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 1:22"/>Then Achicharos interceded for me, and I returned into Nineue. For Achicharos was chief cupbearer and keeper of the signet and in charge of administration and accounts under Sennachereim, the king of the Assyrians, and Sacherdonos appointed him second to himself. Now he was my nephew and from my kinsfolk.<verse eid="TOB 1:22"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:1"/>Then during the reign of King Sarchedonos I returned home, and my wife Hanna and Tobias my son were given back to me. And at our feast of Pentecost, which is the holy feast of weeks, there was a good dinner for me, and I reclined to have dinner.<verse eid="TOB 2:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:2"/>And the table was set for me, and many fine foods were set before me. Then I said to Tobias my son, "My child, go, and bring whatever poor person of our kindred you may find among the Nineuite exiles, who is mindful with his whole heart, and he will eat together with me. And see, I shall wait for you, my child, until you come."<verse eid="TOB 2:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:3"/>So Tobias went to seek some poor person of our kindred. And on his return he said, "Father!" And I said, "Here I am, my child." Then in reply he said, "Father, behold, one of our people has been murdered and thrown into the marketplace and now lies strangled there."<verse eid="TOB 2:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:4"/>So I sprang up, left the dinner before even tasting it and removed him from the square and put him into one of the rooms until the sun set and I would bury him.<verse eid="TOB 2:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:5"/>So returning, I washed myself and ate the bread with mourning.<verse eid="TOB 2:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:6"/>Then I remembered the saying of the prophet, those things that Amos spoke against Baithel, saying, "Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your ways<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = 'songs'</char></note> into lamentation." And I wept.<verse eid="TOB 2:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:7"/>And when the sun had set, I went and dug a grave and buried him.<verse eid="TOB 2:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:8"/>And my neighbors were laughing in scorn, saying, "Is he still not afraid? For he was already sought out to be murdered for this thing, and he ran away. And again, behold, he is burying the dead!"<verse eid="TOB 2:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:9"/>Then the same night I washed myself and went into my courtyard and slept by the wall of the courtyard, and my face was uncovered because of the heat.<verse eid="TOB 2:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:10"/>And I did not know that there were sparrows in the wall above me, and their warm excrement settled into my eyes and brought about white films. So I went to the physicians to be healed, but the more they anointed me with the medicines so much the more were my eyes blinded by the white films until I became completely blind. And I was powerless with my eyes four years. Now all my kindred grieved for me, but Achiacharos supported me two years before he went to Elymais.<verse eid="TOB 2:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:11"/>And at that time Hanna my wife earned money in women's works.<verse eid="TOB 2:11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:12"/>Then she would send what she made to their owners, and they would give her the wages. Now, on the seventh of Dystros, she cut off a piece of weaving and sent it to the owners, and they gave her all the wages and also gave her for the family a kid from the goats.<verse eid="TOB 2:12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:13"/>And when it came in toward me, the kid began to bleat. So I called her and said, "Where is this kid from? It is not stolen, is it? Give it back to its owners, for we have no authority to eat anything stolen."<verse eid="TOB 2:13"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 2:14"/>But she said to me, "It was given to me as a gift in addition to the wages." But I did not believe her and told her to give it back to the owners. And because of this I flushed with anger against her. Then in reply she said to me, "Now where are your acts of charity? Where are your righteous deeds? See, these things are known about you!"<verse eid="TOB 2:14"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:1"/>Then being grief-stricken in spirit and groaning, I wept, and I began to pray with sighs:<verse eid="TOB 3:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:2"/>"You are righteous, O Lord, and all your deeds are righteous, and all your ways are mercy and truth; you judge the age.<verse eid="TOB 3:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:3"/>And now you, O Lord, remember me, and look down. And do not punish me for my sins and for my unwitting offenses and those of my ancestors; they sinned before you,<verse eid="TOB 3:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:4"/>and they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">= Göttingen Ed.</char></note> disobeyed your commandments. And you gave us over to plunder and exile and death and for an illustration and byword and reproach among all the nations among which you have scattered us.<verse eid="TOB 3:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:5"/>And now your many judgments are true in doing with me according to my sins, because we did not keep your commandments and did not walk truthfully before you.<verse eid="TOB 3:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:6"/>So now according to what is pleasing to you do with me, and command my spirit to be taken up from me, that I may be set free from the face of the earth and become earth. For it is better for me to die than to live, because I have heard false reproaches, and great is the grief with me. O Lord, command that I be set free from this distress; set me free into the place everlasting, and do not turn away your face, O Lord, from me. For it is better for me to die than to see great distress in my life, and better not to hear reproaches."<verse eid="TOB 3:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:7"/>On that day, it happened to Sarra daughter of Ragouel at Ecbatana in Media that she also heard reproaches from one of her father's maids.<verse eid="TOB 3:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:8"/>For she had been given to seven husbands, and Asmodaios the wicked demon had killed them before they had been with her as is prescribed for wives. So the maid said to her, "You are the one who kills your husbands! Behold, already you have been given to seven husbands, and you have not borne the name of one of them.<verse eid="TOB 3:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:9"/>Why do you beat us concerning your husbands? Because they are dead? Go with them! And may we never see a son or a daughter of yours!"<verse eid="TOB 3:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:10"/>On that day she was grieved in spirit and wept. And going up into the upper room of her father, she wished to hang herself. But she thought again and said, "Never may they reproach my father and say to him, 'You had only one beloved daughter, but she hanged herself because of her troubles.' And I shall bring down my father's old age with grief into Hades. It is better for me not to hang myself, but to pray the Lord that I may die and no longer hear reproaches in my life."<verse eid="TOB 3:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:11"/>At that same time, stretching out her hands toward the window, she prayed and said, "Blessed are you, merciful God! And blessed is your name forever, and let all your works praise you forever.<verse eid="TOB 3:11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:12"/>And now my face is toward you, and I lift up my eyes.<verse eid="TOB 3:12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:13"/>Command that I be set free from the earth and that I hear reproaches no more.<verse eid="TOB 3:13"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:14"/>You know, O Master, that I am pure from all impurity with a man<verse eid="TOB 3:14"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:15"/>and that I did not defile my name or my father's name in the land of my captivity. I am my father's only begotten, and he has no other child to be his heir, nor has he a near kinsman or other relative that I should keep myself as wife for him. Seven of mine have already died. So why should I still live? But if it does not please you to kill me, O Lord, hear now my reproach."<verse eid="TOB 3:15"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:16"/>At that very moment, the prayer of both was heard in the presence of the glory of God.<verse eid="TOB 3:16"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 3:17"/>And Raphael was sent to heal the two: Tobis, by removing the white films from his eyes so that he might see with his eyes the light of God, and Sarra daughter of Ragouel, by giving her to Tobias son of Tobith as wife and by freeing Asmodaios the wicked demon from her, because Tobias had the right to inherit her before all others who desired to have her. At that moment Tobith returned from the courtyard into his house, and Sarra daughter of Ragouel also came down herself from the upper room.<verse eid="TOB 3:17"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:1"/>On that day Tobith remembered the silver, which he had placed in trust with Gabaelos at Rhaga in Media,<verse eid="TOB 4:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:2"/>and he said in his heart, "Behold, I have asked for death. Why do I not call Tobias my son and inform him about this silver before I die?"<verse eid="TOB 4:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:3"/>Then he called Tobias his son, and he came to him. And he said, "Bury me properly. And honor your mother and do not abandon her all the days of her life. And do what is pleasing before her, and do not grieve her spirit in anything.<verse eid="TOB 4:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:4"/>Remember her, my child, because she experienced many dangers for you in her womb. And when she dies, bury her beside me in one grave.<verse eid="TOB 4:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:5"/>"And all your days, my child, remember the Lord, and do not desire to sin or to transgress his commandments. Do righteous acts all the days of your life, and do not walk in the ways of injustice.<verse eid="TOB 4:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:6"/>For those who keep to the truth will succeed in all their deeds. And to all those who do righteousness, ...<verse eid="TOB 4:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:7"/><verse eid="TOB 4:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:8"/><verse eid="TOB 4:8"/>

    <verse sid="TOB 4:18"/><verse eid="TOB 4:18"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:19"/>... the Lord will give to them good counsel. And if the Lord wishes, he casts down to deepest Hades. So now, my child, remember these commandments, and do not let them be erased from your heart.<verse eid="TOB 4:19"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:20"/>"And now, my child, I will inform you that I placed ten talents of silver in trust with Gabaelos son of Gabri at Rhaga in Media.<verse eid="TOB 4:20"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 4:21"/>So do not be afraid, my child, because we have become poor. You will have many good things if you fear God and flee from every sin and do what is good in the sight of the Lord, your God."<verse eid="TOB 4:21"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:1"/>Then in reply Tobias said to Tobith his father, "Everything that you have commanded me I shall do, father.<verse eid="TOB 5:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:2"/>But how can I get it from him; indeed, he does not know me, nor do I know him? What sign shall I give him, so he will recognize me and believe me and give me the silver? Also, I do not know the roads into Media in order to go there."<verse eid="TOB 5:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:3"/>Then in reply Tobith said to Tobias his son, "He gave me his bond, and I gave him my bond. And I divided it into two, and we each took one part, and I put it in with the silver. And now behold, it is twenty years since I placed this silver in trust. So now, my child, seek for yourself a trustworthy man who will go with you, and we will give him wages until you come. But get this silver from him."<verse eid="TOB 5:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:4"/>So Tobias went out to seek a man who would go with him into Media, who was acquainted with the road. And he went out and found Raphael the angel standing in front of him, but he did not know that he was an angel of God.<verse eid="TOB 5:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:5"/>And he said to him, "Where are you from, young man?" And he said to him, "From the sons of Israel, your kindred, and I have come here to work." Then he said to him, "Do you know the road to go into Media?"<verse eid="TOB 5:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:6"/>And he said to him, "Yes, I have been there many times; I am acquainted with and know all the roads. Often I went into Media, and I stayed with Gabaelos our kinsman who dwells in Rhaga of Media. Now it is a journey of two days from Ecbatana into Rhagai, for it lies in the mountain, Ecbatana in the middle of the plain."<verse eid="TOB 5:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:7"/>Then he said to him, "Wait for me, young man, until I go in and tell my father, for I need you to go with me, and I will give you your wages."<verse eid="TOB 5:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:8"/>And he said, "Behold, I will stay; only do not delay."<verse eid="TOB 5:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:9"/>So Tobias went in to tell Tobith his father and said to him, "Behold, I found a man of our kindred, of the sons of Israel!" And he said to him, "Call the man for me so that I may find out what is his race and to what tribe he belongs and if he is trustworthy so that he may go with you, my child."<verse eid="TOB 5:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:10"/>Then Tobias went out and called him and said to him, "Young man, your father is calling you." So he went in to him, and Tobith greeted him first. And he said to him, "Many joyful greetings to you!" But in reply Tobith said to him, "What is there for me still to be joyful about? Now I am a man with no power in my eyes, and I do not see the light of heaven, but I lie in darkness like the dead who no longer look at the light. Living, I am among the dead. I hear the voice of people, but I do not see them." So he said to him, "Take courage; the time is near for God to heal you; take courage." Then Tobith said to him, "Tobias my son wishes to go into Media. Can you go along with him and lead him? And I will give you your wages, brother." And he said to him, "I can go with him; indeed, I know all the roads. Also I went into Media many times, and I crossed all its plains, and I know its mountains and all its roads."<verse eid="TOB 5:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:11"/>Then he said to him, "Brother, of what family are you and from what tribe? Tell me, brother."<verse eid="TOB 5:11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:12"/>And he said, "Why, do you need a tribe?" And he said to him, "I want to know the truth about whose son you are, brother, and what your name is."<verse eid="TOB 5:12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:13"/>So he said to him, "I am Azarias son of Hananias the great, one of your relatives."<verse eid="TOB 5:13"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:14"/>Then he said to him, "Come in, brother, in good health and safety! And do not be bitter toward me, brother, because I wanted to know the truth about your family also. Now you happen to be a relative, and you are of a noble and good lineage. I knew Hananias and Nathan, the two sons of Semelias the great, and they would go with me into Ierousalem and do obeisance with me there, and they did not err. Your relatives are good people; you are of good stock. So come in with joy!"<verse eid="TOB 5:14"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:15"/>Then he said to him, "I will give you a drachma a day as wages, and what is needed for you as well as for my son. So go with my son.<verse eid="TOB 5:15"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:16"/>I will also add more to your wages." And he said to him, "I shall go with him; so do not fear. We shall go away in good health, and we shall return to you in good health, because the road is safe."<verse eid="TOB 5:16"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:17"/>So he said to him, "Blessing be upon you, brother." Then he called his son and said to him, "My child, prepare the things for the journey, and go out with your brother. And may God in heaven bring you safely there and restore you back to me in good health, and may his angel journey along with you in safety, my child." And he went out to go on his journey, and he kissed his father and mother. Then Tobith said to him, "Go in good health."<verse eid="TOB 5:17"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:18"/>But his mother wept and said to Tobith, "Why is it that you have sent my child away? Is he not the rod of our hand as he goes in and goes out before us?<verse eid="TOB 5:18"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:19"/>Do not add silver to silver, but let it be a ransom for our child.<verse eid="TOB 5:19"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:20"/>For as it has been given to us to live by the Lord, that is enough."<verse eid="TOB 5:20"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:21"/>And he said to her, "Do not worry; our child will go in good health and come back to us in good health. And your eyes will see him<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">5:21</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = Omit</char></note> on the day when he comes back to you in good health. Do not worry! Do not fear for them, my sister.<verse eid="TOB 5:21"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 5:22"/>For a good angel will accompany him, and his journey will be successful, and he will come back in good health."<verse eid="TOB 5:22"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:1"/>So she stopped weeping.<verse eid="TOB 6:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:2"/>Then the child went out, and the angel with him, and the dog went out with him and walked with them. And they both walked, and the first night came upon them, and they camped by the Tigris River.<verse eid="TOB 6:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:3"/>Then the child went down to wash his feet in the Tigris River. And a large fish, leaping up from the water, wanted to swallow the foot of the young man, and he cried out.<verse eid="TOB 6:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:4"/>Then the angel said to the young man, "Take hold of the fish, and hang on!" So the child seized the fish and carried it up onto the land.<verse eid="TOB 6:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:5"/>Then the angel said to him, "Rip open the fish, and take out its gall and heart and liver, and put them aside with you, but the entrails throw away. For its gall and heart and liver are useful as medicine."<verse eid="TOB 6:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:6"/>So cutting open the fish, the young man gathered together the gall and heart and liver; then he roasted and ate some of the fish and kept some of it salted. And the two walked together until they drew near to Media.<verse eid="TOB 6:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:7"/>And then the young man asked the angel and said to him, "Brother Azarias, what is the medicine in the fish's heart and liver and in the gall?"<verse eid="TOB 6:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:8"/>And he said to him, "As for the fish's heart and liver, burn them to smoke in the presence of a man or woman afflicted by a demon or evil spirit, and every affliction will flee away from him and will not remain with him any longer.<verse eid="TOB 6:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:9"/>And as for the gall, anoint a person's eyes on which white films have come up; blow upon them, upon the white films, and they will be healed."<verse eid="TOB 6:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:10"/>And when he went into Media and already drew near to Ecbatana,<verse eid="TOB 6:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:11"/>Raphael said to the young man, "Brother Tobias." And he said to him, "Here I am." Then he said to him, "This night we must stay in the home of Ragouelos. Now the man is your relative, and he has a beautiful<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">6:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = Omit</char></note> daughter whose name is Sarra.<verse eid="TOB 6:11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:12"/>And he has no male son or daughter except Sarra alone, and you are closer to her than all other men, to have her as an inheritance. And it is right for you to have her father's possessions as an inheritance. Also the girl is sensible and brave and very beautiful, and her father is noble."<verse eid="TOB 6:12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:13"/>And he said, "It is right for you to take her. So listen to me, brother, and I shall speak to the father about the girl this night so that we may take her to be your bride. And, when we return from Rhaga, we shall celebrate her wedding feast. And I know that Ragouel cannot keep her from you or promise her to another; he would be liable to death according to the decree of the book of Moyses. And he knows that the inheritance is yours by right to take his daughter before any other man. So now listen to me, brother, and we shall speak this night concerning the girl and have her engaged to you. And, when we return from Rhaga, we shall take her and bring her back with us into your house."<verse eid="TOB 6:13"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:14"/>Then in reply Tobias said to Raphael, "Brother Azarias, I heard that she already has been given to seven husbands, and they died in their bridal chamber. On the night when they went in toward her, they would die. And I heard people say that a demon kills them.<verse eid="TOB 6:14"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:15"/>And now I am afraid-- for it does not harm her, but anyone who desires to approach her it kills; I am my father's only son-- that I may die and bring my father's and my mother's life, because of me, to their grave with sorrow. And they have no other son, that he may bury them."<verse eid="TOB 6:15"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:16"/>But he said to him, "Do you not remember your father's commandments, that he commanded you to take a wife from your father's house? So now listen to me, brother, and do not worry about this demon, and take her. And I know that this night a wife will be given to you.<verse eid="TOB 6:16"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:17"/>Now when you go into the bridal chamber, take some of the fish's liver and heart, and put them on the embers of the incense, and the smell will go forth.<verse eid="TOB 6:17"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 6:18"/>Then the demon will smell it and flee and will never be seen around her any more. And when you are about to be with her, get up first, both of you, and pray, and beseech the Lord of heaven that mercy and safety may be upon you. So do not be afraid, for she was set apart for you from of old. And you will save her, and she will go with you. And I suppose that you will have children by her, and they will be as brothers to you. Do not worry!" Now when Tobias heard the words of Raphael, and that she was his kinswoman of the lineage of his father's house, he loved her very much, and his heart clung to her.<verse eid="TOB 6:18"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:1"/>Now when they<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">7:1</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = 'he'</char></note> entered into Ecbatana, he said to him, "Brother Azarias, lead me straight to Ragouel our brother." So he led him into the house of Ragouelos, and they found him sitting beside the door of the courtyard. And they greeted him first, and he said to them, "Many joyful greetings, brothers, and welcome in good health!" Then he led them into his house.<verse eid="TOB 7:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:2"/>And he said to Edna his wife, "How much this young man resembles Tobis my kinsman!"<verse eid="TOB 7:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:3"/>Then Edna asked them and said to them, "Where are you from, brothers?" And they said to her, "We belong to the children of Nephthaleim, who were taken captive in Nineue."<verse eid="TOB 7:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:4"/>So she said to them, "Do you know Tobis our kinsman?" And they said to her, "We do know him." Then she said to them, "Is he in good health?"<verse eid="TOB 7:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:5"/>And they said to her, "He is in good health and alive." And Tobias said, "He is my father!"<verse eid="TOB 7:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:6"/>Then Ragouel jumped up and kissed him and wept.<verse eid="TOB 7:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:7"/>And he spoke and said to him, "Blessings on you, my child, son of a noble and good father! O most miserable of calamities that a righteous man who also gives alms has become blind!" Then he fell on the neck of Tobias his kinsman and wept.<verse eid="TOB 7:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:8"/>Also Edna his wife wept for him, and Sarra their daughter likewise wept.<verse eid="TOB 7:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:9"/>Then he slaughtered a ram from the flock and welcomed them very warmly. Now when they had bathed and washed themselves and had reclined to have dinner, Tobias said to Raphael, "Brother Azarias, speak to Ragouel that he give to me Sarra my kinswoman."<verse eid="TOB 7:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:10"/>But Ragouel heard the word and said to the lad, "Eat, and drink, and be merry this night. For there is no man who has the right to take Sarra my daughter except you, brother. Likewise I myself do not have the authority to give her to any other man except you, because you are my nearest relative. But let me explain to you the truth more fully, my child.<verse eid="TOB 7:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:11"/>I have given her to seven men of our kinsmen, and all died on the night when they went in toward her. So now, my child, eat, and drink, and the Lord will do something with you both." Then Tobias said, "I will neither eat nor drink until you settle the things that pertain to me." So Ragouel said to him, "I will do it. Indeed, she is given to you according to the decree of the book of Moyses, and from heaven it has been decreed that she be given to you. Take your kinswoman; from now on you are her brother, and she is your sister. She has been given to you from today and forever. And may the Lord of heaven prosper you both this night, my child, and grant you mercy and peace."<verse eid="TOB 7:11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:12"/>Then Ragouel called Sarra his daughter. And she came to him. Then taking her hand, he gave her over to him and said, "Take her according to the law, and according to the decree written in the book of Moyses she is your wife. Take her, and lead her away in good health to your father. And may the God of heaven prosper you both with peace."<verse eid="TOB 7:12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:13"/>Then he called her mother and told her to bring a scroll, and he wrote out a contract, a scroll of marriage, that he gave her to him as wife according to the decree of the law of Moyses.<verse eid="TOB 7:13"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:14"/>After that they began to eat and to drink.<verse eid="TOB 7:14"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:15"/>Then Ragouel called Edna his wife and said to her, "My sister, prepare the other room, and lead her in there."<verse eid="TOB 7:15"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:16"/>So she went and made the bed in the room as he had told her, and she led her there. And she wept for her. Then she wiped away the tears and said to her,<verse eid="TOB 7:16"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 7:17"/>"Take courage, my daughter; may the Lord of heaven grant you joy in place of your sorrow. Take courage, my daughter." Then she went out.<verse eid="TOB 7:17"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:1"/>When they had finished eating and drinking, they wanted to go to sleep; so they led the young man out and led him into the room.<verse eid="TOB 8:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:2"/>Then Tobias remembered the words of Raphael, and he took the fish's liver and heart out of the bag where he had them and put them on the embers of the incense.<verse eid="TOB 8:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:3"/>And the odor of the fish became a hindrance, and the demon fled into the upper parts<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">8:3</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'into the upper parts': Göttingen Ed. = 'upward into the parts'</char></note> of Egypt. But Raphael went and bound him there hand and foot and tied him up at once.<verse eid="TOB 8:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:4"/>Then they went out and shut the door of the room. And Tobias got up from the bed and said to her, "Sister, get up, let us pray and implore our Lord that he grant us mercy and safety."<verse eid="TOB 8:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:5"/>So she got up, and they began to pray and implore that safety may be theirs. And he began to say, "Blessed are you, O God of our ancestors, and blessed be your name for all the ages forever. Let the heavens and all your creation bless you for all the ages.<verse eid="TOB 8:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:6"/>You made Adam, and you made for him a helper, a support-- his wife Heua. And from the two of them the human race has come. And you said, 'It is not good for the man to be alone; let us make for him a helper like himself.'<verse eid="TOB 8:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:7"/>And now not because of lust am I taking this kinswoman of mine, but with sincerity. Grant that I and she may have mercy and that we may grow old together."<verse eid="TOB 8:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:8"/>And they said with each other, "Amen, Amen."<verse eid="TOB 8:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:9"/>Then they went to sleep for the night. But Ragouel got up and called his servants to him, and they went and dug a grave,<verse eid="TOB 8:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:10"/>for he said, "Perhaps he may die, and we may become an object of ridicule and derision."<verse eid="TOB 8:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:11"/>And when they had finished digging the grave, Ragouel went into the house and called his wife,<verse eid="TOB 8:11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:12"/>and he said, "Send one of the maids, and have her go in to see if he is alive. But if he is dead, let us bury him so that no one may know."<verse eid="TOB 8:12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:13"/>So they sent the maid and lit the lamp and opened the door, and she went in and found them lying there fast asleep together.<verse eid="TOB 8:13"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:14"/>And the maid went out and told them that he was alive and that nothing was wrong.<verse eid="TOB 8:14"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:15"/>So they blessed the God of heaven, and they said, "Blessed are you, O God, with every pure blessing, and may they bless you forever and ever.<verse eid="TOB 8:15"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:16"/>And blessed are you because you have made me glad, and it did not turn out as I expected, but according to your great mercy you have dealt with us.<verse eid="TOB 8:16"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:17"/>And blessed are you because you had mercy on two only children. Have mercy on them, O Master, and keep them safe, and bring their life to fulfillment with gladness and mercy."<verse eid="TOB 8:17"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:18"/>Then he told his domestics to fill in the grave before it became dawn.<verse eid="TOB 8:18"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:19"/>And he told his wife to make many loaves of bread, and he went out to the herd and brought two steers and four rams and commanded that they be killed. So they began to make preparations.<verse eid="TOB 8:19"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:20"/>Then he called Tobias and swore an oath to him and said<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">8:20</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'swore an oath to him and said': Göttingen Ed. = 'said to him'</char></note>: "For fourteen days you shall not move from here but shall stay here eating and drinking with me, and you shall make my daughter's spirit glad which has been depressed.<verse eid="TOB 8:20"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 8:21"/>Then take at once half of what I own and return in good health to your father, and the other half will be yours when I die, and my wife as well. Take courage, my child. I am your father, and Edna is your mother, and we belong to you and to your kinswoman now and forever. Take courage, my child."<verse eid="TOB 8:21"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 9:1"/>Then Tobias called Raphael and said to him,<verse eid="TOB 9:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 9:2"/>"Brother Azarias, take with you four domestics and two camels, and go to Rhagai. And go to the house of Gabaelos, and give him the bond, and get the silver, and then bring him back with you to the wedding feast.<verse eid="TOB 9:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 9:3"/>-<verse eid="TOB 9:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 9:4"/>For you know that my father is counting the days, and if I delay one day, I will grieve him very much. And you see how Ragouel has sworn, and I cannot violate his oath."<verse eid="TOB 9:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 9:5"/>So Raphael and the four servants and two camels went into Rhagai in Media and stayed with Gabaelos. Then he gave him his bond and told him about Tobias son of Tobith, that he had taken a wife and invited him to the wedding feast. So he got up and counted out for him the money bags, with the seals; then they loaded them on the camels<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:5</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = 'put them together'</char></note>.<verse eid="TOB 9:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 9:6"/>And they both got up early in the morning and went to the wedding feast. And they went to Ragouel's place and found Tobias reclining at table. Then he sprang up and greeted him, and he wept and blessed him and said, "Noble and good son of a noble and good, upright and charitable man, may the Lord give the blessing of heaven to you and to your wife and to your father and to the mother of your wife. Blessed be God, for I see Tobis my cousin who is just like him."<verse eid="TOB 9:6"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:1"/>Now day by day Tobith was counting the days on which Tobias would need for going and for coming back. And when the days had been completed and his son did not appear,<verse eid="TOB 10:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:2"/>he said, "Perhaps he has been detained there? Or perhaps Gabael has died, and no one is giving him the silver?"<verse eid="TOB 10:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:3"/>And he began to grieve.<verse eid="TOB 10:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:4"/>Then Hanna his wife said, "My child has perished and is no longer among the living." And she began to weep and mourn for her son, and she said,<verse eid="TOB 10:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:5"/>"Woe to me, my child, the light of my eyes, that I let you go!"<verse eid="TOB 10:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:6"/>But Tobith said to her, "Be quiet, and do not worry, my sister; he is in good health. And they probably had a distraction there. Also the man who went with him is trustworthy and is one of our own kindred. Do not grieve for him, my sister; he will soon be here."<verse eid="TOB 10:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:7"/>Then she said to him, "Be quiet; away from me! And stop deceiving me! My child has perished." And she would rush out every day and watch the road on which her son had gone, and she would not believe anyone. And when the sun had set she would go in and mourn and weep the whole night and get no sleep. Now when the fourteen days of the wedding feast had ended that Ragouel had sworn to have for his daughter, Tobias came to him and said, "Send me back, for I know that my father and mother do not believe that they will see me again. So now I beg you, father, that you send me away and that I may go to my father. I have already explained to you how I left him."<verse eid="TOB 10:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:8"/>But Ragouel said to Tobias, "Stay, my child, stay with me, and I shall send messengers to Tobis your father, and they will inform him about you."<verse eid="TOB 10:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:9"/>But he said to him, "By no means! I beg you that you send me back from here to my father."<verse eid="TOB 10:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:10"/>So Ragouel got up and gave Tobias Sarra his wife and half of all his property-- male and female slaves, oxen and sheep, asses and camels, clothing and silver and utensils.<verse eid="TOB 10:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:11"/>Then he sent them away in good health, and he embraced him and said to him, "Good health, my child; go away in good health. The Lord of heaven prosper you and Sarra your wife, and may I see your children before I die."<verse eid="TOB 10:11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:12"/>Then he said to Sarra his daughter, "My daughter, honor your father-in-law and your mother-in-law<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">10:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'My daughter, honor your father-in-law and your mother-in-law': Göttingen Ed. = 'Go to your father-in-law'</char></note>, for from now on they are as much your parents as those who gave you birth. Go in peace, my daughter; may I hear a good report about you as long as I live." And he took leave of them and let them go. Then Edna said to Tobias, "My child and dear brother, may the Lord of heaven bring you back safely, and while I live before I die, may I see children of you and my daughter Sarra. In the sight of the Lord I entrust to you my daughter as a pledge; do not grieve her all the days of your life. My child, peace. From now on I am your mother, and Sarra is your sister. May we all prosper together all the days of our life." Then she kissed them both and sent them away in good health.<verse eid="TOB 10:12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 10:13"/>Then Tobias went away from Ragouel in good health and rejoicing and blessing the Lord of heaven and earth, the king of all, because he had made his journey a success. Then he said to him, "May it go well for you to honor them all the days of their life."<verse eid="TOB 10:13"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:1"/>When they came near to Kaserein, which is opposite Nineue,<verse eid="TOB 11:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:2"/>Raphael said, "You know how we left your father.<verse eid="TOB 11:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:3"/>Let us run on ahead of your wife and prepare the house while they are on the way."<verse eid="TOB 11:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:4"/>So the two of them went together, and he said to him, "Take the gall with your hands." And the dog came along behind them.<verse eid="TOB 11:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:5"/>Now Hanna sat looking intently at the road for her son.<verse eid="TOB 11:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:6"/>And she caught sight of him coming, and she said to his father, "Behold, your son is coming, and the man who went with him!"<verse eid="TOB 11:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:7"/>Then Raphael said to Tobias, before he had approached his father, "I know that his eyes will be opened.<verse eid="TOB 11:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:8"/>Sprinkle the gall of the fish on his eyes, and the medicine will make the white films contract and peel off from his eyes, and your father will look up and see the light."<verse eid="TOB 11:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:9"/>Then Hanna ran up and fell on the neck of her son and said to him, "I see you, my child; from now on I am ready to die." And she wept.<verse eid="TOB 11:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:10"/>Then Tobis got up and stumbled on his feet and went out the door of the courtyard. And Tobias went up to him.<verse eid="TOB 11:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:11"/>Now the gall of the fish was in his hand, and he blew into his eyes and held him and said, "Take courage, father." Then he lay the medicine on him, and it worked<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">11:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'it worked':  Greek uncertain</char></note>.<verse eid="TOB 11:11"/>

    <verse sid="TOB 11:13"/>And he scaled it off with both his hands from the corners of his eyes. Then he fell on his neck,<verse eid="TOB 11:13"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:14"/>and he wept and said to him, "I see you, my child, the light of my eyes!" Then he said, "Blessed be God, and blessed be his great name, and blessed be all his holy angels. May his great name be upon us, and may all the angels be blessed throughout all the ages.<verse eid="TOB 11:14"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:15"/>For he afflicted me, but behold, I see Tobias my son!" And Tobias went in rejoicing and blessing God with full voice. Then Tobias told his father that his journey had been successful and that he had brought the silver and that he had taken Sarra daughter of Ragouel as wife and that behold, she is arriving and is near the gate of Nineue.<verse eid="TOB 11:15"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:16"/>Then Tobith went out to the gate of Nineue to meet his daughter-in-law, rejoicing and blessing God. Now the people of Nineue, seeing him walking and moving along in all his strength and with no one leading him, were amazed.<verse eid="TOB 11:16"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 11:17"/>And Tobith acknowledged before them that God had been merciful to him and that he had opened his eyes. Then Tobith approached Sarra, the wife of Tobias his son, and he blessed her and said to her, "Come in, in good health, daughter, and blessed be your God, who has brought you to us, daughter. And blessed be your father and your mother<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">11:17</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Göttingen Ed. = Omit</char></note>, and blessed be Tobias my son, and blessed be you, daughter.

    <verse sid="TOB 11:18"/>And Achikar and Nabad his nephews came rejoicing to Tobis.<verse eid="TOB 11:18"/>



  <chapter sid="TOB 12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:1"/>Now when the wedding feast was ended, Tobith called Tobias his son and said to him, "My child, see that you give the wages to the man who went with you, even add to his wages."<verse eid="TOB 12:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:2"/>So he said to him, "Father, how much shall I give him as his wages? It would do me no harm to give him half of the possessions he brought back with me.<verse eid="TOB 12:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:3"/>He has led me back in good health and cured my wife and brought the silver with me, and he healed you. How much shall I still give him as wages?"<verse eid="TOB 12:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:4"/>Then Tobis said to him, "It is his right, my child, to take half of all that he came back with."<verse eid="TOB 12:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:5"/>So he called him and said, "Take half of all that you came back with for your wages, and go away in good health."<verse eid="TOB 12:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:6"/>Then he called the two in secret and said to them, "Bless God, and before all the living acknowledge him for the good things he has done for you. Bless, and sing praise to his name. The words of God declare with honor to all people. And do not hesitate to acknowledge him.<verse eid="TOB 12:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:7"/>It is good to conceal the secret of a king, but to reveal and acknowledge honorably the works of God. Do what is good, and evil will not overtake you.<verse eid="TOB 12:7"/>

It is better to give alms rather than to store up gold.<verse eid="TOB 12:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:9"/>Almsgiving delivers from death, and it purges away every sin. Those who give alms will enjoy life to the full.<verse eid="TOB 12:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:10"/>Those who commit sin and injustice are enemies of their own self.<verse eid="TOB 12:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:11"/>"I shall declare the whole truth to you, and I will not conceal any word from you. Already I declared to you and said, 'It is good to conceal the secret of a king, but to reveal gloriously the works of God.'<verse eid="TOB 12:11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:12"/>So now when you and Sarra prayed, I brought the memorial of your prayer before the glory of the Lord and did likewise when you would bury the dead.<verse eid="TOB 12:12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:13"/>And when you did not hesitate to get up and leave your dinner and when you went and buried the dead,<verse eid="TOB 12:13"/>

    <verse sid="TOB 12:16"/>Then they were both troubled, and they fell on their face, and they were afraid.<verse eid="TOB 12:16"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 12:17"/>But he said to them, "Do not be afraid; peace be with you. Bless God forevermore.<verse eid="TOB 12:17"/>

    <verse sid="TOB 14:1"/>Then the words of Tobith's praise were completed. And he died in peace at one hundred twelve years, and he was buried with honor in Nineue.<verse eid="TOB 14:1"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:2"/>Now he was sixty-two years old when he became maimed in his eyes, and after he saw again he lived in prosperity and gave alms. And he still continued to bless God and to acknowledge the majesty of God.<verse eid="TOB 14:2"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:3"/>Now when he was about to die, he called Tobias his son and commanded him, saying: "My child, take your children,<verse eid="TOB 14:3"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:4"/>and hurry off into Media, for I believe the word of God about Nineue, the things Naoum spoke, that all these things will come about and happen to Athour and Nineue. Also everything that the prophets of Israel spoke, those whom God sent, will happen. And not one of all their words will fail, but all will come true at their appointed times. So in Media there will be safety rather than among the Assyrians or in Babylon. For I know and believe that all things that God said will be fulfilled and will come to pass, and no utterance of his words shall fail. And our kindred, who live in the land of Israel, all will be scattered and taken as captives from the good land, and the whole land of Israel will be desolate, even Samaria and Ierousalem will be desolate. And the house of God will be in grief and will be burned down for a time.<verse eid="TOB 14:4"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:5"/>"But again God will have mercy on them, and God will bring them back into the land of Israel, and again they will build the house, but not like the first one, until the time when the time of the appointed times will be completed. Then after this they all will return from their captivity, and they will build Ierousalem honorably. And the house of God will be built in it, just as the prophets of Israel said concerning it.<verse eid="TOB 14:5"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:6"/>Then all the nations in the whole world will turn back and truly fear God. And all will abandon their idols, which deceitfully have made them err in their error.<verse eid="TOB 14:6"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:7"/>And they will bless the God of the ages in righteousness. All the sons of Israel who are saved in those days, mindful of God in truth, will be gathered together. And they will go into Ierousalem and live forever in the land of Abraam with security, and it will be given over to them. And those who love God in truth will rejoice, but those who commit sin and injustice will vanish from all the earth.<verse eid="TOB 14:7"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:8"/>(8-9) "So now, my children, I command you, serve God in truth, and do what is pleasing before him. Also your children are to be commanded to practice righteousness and almsgiving and to be mindful of God and bless his name at every moment in truth and with all their strength. "So now, my child, go out from Nineue, and do not remain here.<verse eid="TOB 14:8"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:9"/><verse eid="TOB 14:9"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:10"/>On the day you bury your mother with me, on that day do not spend the night within its borders. For I see that there is much injustice within it and that much deceit is accomplished within it, and they are not ashamed. See, my child, what Nadab did to Achikaros who had reared him. Was he not, while still alive, brought down into the earth? And God repaid the dishonor to his face. Now Achikaros came out into the light, but Nadab went into the everlasting darkness, because he sought to kill Achikaros. Because he gave alms, he came out of the death trap that Nadab had set for him, but Nadab fell into the death trap himself, and it destroyed him.<verse eid="TOB 14:10"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:11"/>So now, my children, see what almsgiving does and what injustice does: it kills! But behold, my soul is about to leave." Then they laid him on the bed, and he died, and he was buried honorably.<verse eid="TOB 14:11"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:12"/>And when his mother died, Tobias buried her with his father. Then he and his wife went away to Media and dwelled in Ecbatana with Ragouelos his father-in-law.<verse eid="TOB 14:12"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:13"/>He tended to them respectfully in their old age, and he buried them at Ecbatana in Media. Then he inherited the house of Ragouelos and that of Tobith his father.<verse eid="TOB 14:13"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:14"/>Then he died honorably at the age of one hundred seventeen years.<verse eid="TOB 14:14"/>
    <verse sid="TOB 14:15"/>And before he died he saw and heard of the destruction of Nineue, and he saw its captivity being led into Media, which Achiacharos, the king of Media, had taken captive. And he blessed God for all the things that he had done to the sons of Nineue and Athouria; before he died he rejoiced over Nineue, and he blessed the Lord God forever and ever.
