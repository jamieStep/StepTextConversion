  <chapter sid="GEN 1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:1"/>In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth.<verse eid="GEN 1:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:2"/>Yet the earth was invisible and unformed, and darkness was over the abyss, and a divine wind was being carried along over the water.<verse eid="GEN 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:3"/>And God said, "Let light come into being." And light came into being.<verse eid="GEN 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:4"/>And God saw the light, that it was good. And God separated between the light and between the darkness.<verse eid="GEN 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:5"/>And God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night. And it came to be evening, and it came to be morning, day one.<verse eid="GEN 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:6"/>And God said, "Let a firmament come into being in the midst of the water, and let it be a separator between water and water." And it became so.<verse eid="GEN 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:7"/>And God made the firmament, and God separated between the water that was under the firmament and between the water that was above the firmament.<verse eid="GEN 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:8"/>And God called the firmament Sky. And God saw that it was good. And it came to be evening, and it came to be morning, a second day.<verse eid="GEN 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:9"/>And God said, "Let the water that is under the sky be gathered into one gathering, and let the dry land appear." And it became so. And the water that was under the sky was gathered into their gatherings, and the dry land appeared.<verse eid="GEN 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:10"/>And God called the dry land Earth, and the systems of the waters he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.<verse eid="GEN 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:11"/>Then God said, "Let the earth put forth pasture land vegetation, seed propagating according to kind and according to likeness, and fruit-bearing tree producing fruit of which the seed is in it according to kind, on the earth." And it became so.<verse eid="GEN 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:12"/>And the earth brought forth pasture land vegetation, seed propagating according to kind and according to likeness, and fruit-bearing tree producing fruit of which the seed is in it according to kind, on the earth. And God saw that it was good.<verse eid="GEN 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:13"/>And it came to be evening, and it came to be morning, a third day.<verse eid="GEN 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:14"/>And God said, "Let luminaries come into being in the firmament of the sky for illumination of the earth, to separate between the day and between the night, and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and for years,<verse eid="GEN 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:15"/>and let them be for illumination in the firmament of the sky so as to give light upon the earth." And it became so.<verse eid="GEN 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:16"/>And God made the two great luminaries, the great luminary for rulership of the day and the lesser luminary for rulership of the night, and the stars.<verse eid="GEN 1:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:17"/>And God set them in the firmament of the sky so as to give light upon the earth<verse eid="GEN 1:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:18"/>and to rule the day and the night and to separate between the light and between the darkness. And God saw that it was good.<verse eid="GEN 1:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:19"/>And it came to be evening, and it came to be morning, a fourth day.<verse eid="GEN 1:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:20"/>And God said, "Let the waters bring forth creeping things among living creatures and birds flying on the earth against the firmament of the sky." And it became so.<verse eid="GEN 1:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:21"/>And God made the great sea monsters and every creature among creeping animals, which the waters brought forth according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to kind. And God saw that they were good.<verse eid="GEN 1:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:22"/>And God blessed them, saying, "Increase, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."<verse eid="GEN 1:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:23"/>And it came to be evening, and it came to be morning, a fifth day.<verse eid="GEN 1:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:24"/>And God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature according to kind: quadrupeds and creeping things and wild animals of the earth according to kind." And it became so.<verse eid="GEN 1:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:25"/>And God made the wild animals of the earth according to kind and the cattle according to kind and all the creeping things of the earth according to their kind. And God saw that they were good.<verse eid="GEN 1:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:26"/>Then God said, "Let us make humankind according to our image and according to likeness, and let them rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the sky and the cattle and all the earth and all the creeping things that creep upon the earth."<verse eid="GEN 1:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:27"/>And God made humankind; according to divine image he made it; male and female he made them.<verse eid="GEN 1:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:28"/>And God blessed them, saying, "Increase, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule the fish of the sea and the birds of the sky and all the cattle and all the earth and all the creeping things that creep upon the earth."<verse eid="GEN 1:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:29"/>And God said, "See, I have given to you all sowable herbage, propagating seed that is atop the whole earth, and every tree that has in itself fruit of sowable seed-- you shall have it<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:29</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'them'</char></note> for food,<verse eid="GEN 1:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:30"/>and to all the wild animals of the earth and to all the birds of the sky and to every creeping thing that creeps on the earth that has in itself the animating force of life, even all green herbage for food." And it became so.<verse eid="GEN 1:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 1:31"/>And God saw all the things that he had made, and see, they were exceedingly good. And it came to be evening, and it came to be morning, a sixth day.<verse eid="GEN 1:31"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:1"/>And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all their arrangement.<verse eid="GEN 2:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:2"/>And on the sixth day God finished his works that he had made, and he left off on the seventh day from all his works that he had made.<verse eid="GEN 2:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:3"/>And God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it he left off from all his works that God had begun to make.<verse eid="GEN 2:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:4"/>This is the book of the origin of heaven and earth, when it originated, on the day that God made the heaven and the earth<verse eid="GEN 2:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:5"/>and all verdure of the field before it came to be upon the earth and all herbage of the field before it sprang up, for God had not sent rain upon the earth, and there was not a human to till the earth,<verse eid="GEN 2:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:6"/>yet a spring would rise from the earth and water the whole face of the earth.<verse eid="GEN 2:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:7"/>And God formed man, dust from the earth, and breathed into his face a breath of life, and the man became a living being.<verse eid="GEN 2:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:8"/>And the Lord God planted an orchard in Edem toward the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.<verse eid="GEN 2:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:9"/>And out of the earth God furthermore made to grow every tree that is beautiful to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the orchard's midst and the tree for knowing what is knowable of good and evil.<verse eid="GEN 2:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:10"/>Now a river goes out of Edem to water the orchard; from there it divides into four sources.<verse eid="GEN 2:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:11"/>The name of the one is Phison; it is the one that encircles the whole land of Heuilat, there where the gold is;<verse eid="GEN 2:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:12"/>now the gold of that land is good, and carbuncle and light green stone are there.<verse eid="GEN 2:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:13"/>And the second river's name is Geon; it is the one that encircles the whole land of Ethiopia.<verse eid="GEN 2:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:14"/>And the third river is the Tigris; it is the one that goes over against the Assyrians. As for the fourth river, it is the Euphrates.<verse eid="GEN 2:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:15"/>And the Lord God took the man whom he had formed and put him in the orchard to till and keep it.<verse eid="GEN 2:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:16"/>And the Lord God commanded Adam, saying, "You shall eat for food of every tree that is in the orchard,<verse eid="GEN 2:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:17"/>but of the tree for knowing good and evil, of it you shall not eat; on the day that you eat of it, you shall die by death."<verse eid="GEN 2:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:18"/>Then the Lord God said, "It is not good that the man is alone; let us make him a helper corresponding to him."<verse eid="GEN 2:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:19"/>And out of the earth God furthermore formed all the animals of the field and all the birds of the sky and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them, and anything, whatever Adam called it as living creature, this was its name.<verse eid="GEN 2:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:20"/>And Adam gave names to all the cattle and to all the birds of the sky and to all the animals of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper like him.<verse eid="GEN 2:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:21"/>And God cast a trance upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs and filled up flesh in its place.<verse eid="GEN 2:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:22"/>And the rib that he had taken from Adam the Lord God fashioned into a woman and brought her to Adam.<verse eid="GEN 2:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:23"/>And Adam said, "This now is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman, for out of her husband she was taken."<verse eid="GEN 2:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 2:24"/>Therefore a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.<verse eid="GEN 2:24"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:1"/>(2.25) And the two were naked, both Adam and his wife, and were not ashamed.(3.1) Now the snake was the most sagacious of all the wild animals that were upon the earth, which<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:1</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the wild animals'</char></note> the Lord God had made. And the snake said to the woman, "Why is it that God said, 'You shall not eat from any tree that is in the orchard'?"<verse eid="GEN 3:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:2"/>And the woman said to the snake, "We shall eat of the fruit of the tree of the orchard,<verse eid="GEN 3:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:3"/>but of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the orchard, God said, 'You shall not eat of it nor shall you even touch it, lest you die.' "<verse eid="GEN 3:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:4"/>And the snake said to the woman, "You will not die by death,<verse eid="GEN 3:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:5"/>for God knew that on the day you eat of it, your eyes would be opened, and you would be like gods knowing good and evil."<verse eid="GEN 3:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:6"/>And the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasing for the eyes to look at and it was beautiful to contemplate, and when she had taken of its fruit she ate, and she also gave some to her husband with her, and they ate.<verse eid="GEN 3:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:7"/>And the eyes of the two were opened, and they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.<verse eid="GEN 3:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:8"/>And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking about in the orchard in the evening, and both Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God in the midst of the timber of the orchard.<verse eid="GEN 3:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:9"/>And the Lord God called Adam and said to him, "Adam, where are you?"<verse eid="GEN 3:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:10"/>And he said to him, "I heard the sound of you walking about in the orchard, and I was afraid, because I am naked, and I hid myself."<verse eid="GEN 3:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:11"/>And he said to him, "Who told you that you are naked, unless you have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, of this one alone, not to eat from it?"<verse eid="GEN 3:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:12"/>And Adam said, "The woman, whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate."<verse eid="GEN 3:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:13"/>And God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?" And the woman said, "The snake tricked me, and I ate."<verse eid="GEN 3:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:14"/>And the Lord God said to the snake, "Because you have done this, cursed are you from all the domestic animals and from all the wild animals of the earth; upon your chest and belly you shall go, and earth you shall eat all the days of your life.<verse eid="GEN 3:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:15"/>And I will put enmity between you and between the woman and between your offspring and between her offspring; he will watch your head, and you will watch his heel."<verse eid="GEN 3:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:16"/>And to the woman he said, "I will increasingly increase your pains and your groaning; with pains you will bring forth children. And your recourse<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:16</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'return'</char></note> will be to your husband, and he will dominate you."<verse eid="GEN 3:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:17"/>Then to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you, of this one alone, not to eat from it, cursed is the earth in your labors; with pains you will eat it all the days of your life;<verse eid="GEN 3:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:18"/>thorns and thistles it shall cause to grow up for you, and you will eat the herbage of the field.<verse eid="GEN 3:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:19"/>By the sweat of your face you will eat your bread until you return to the earth from which you were taken, for you are earth and to earth you will depart."<verse eid="GEN 3:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:20"/>And Adam called the name of his wife Life, because she is the mother of all the living.<verse eid="GEN 3:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:21"/>And the Lord God made leather tunics for Adam and for his wife and clothed them.<verse eid="GEN 3:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:22"/>Then God said, "See, Adam has become like one of us, knowing good and evil, and now perhaps he might reach out his hand and take of the tree of life and eat, and he will live forever."<verse eid="GEN 3:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:23"/>And the Lord God sent him forth from the orchard of delight to till the earth from which he was taken.<verse eid="GEN 3:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 3:24"/>And he drove Adam out and caused him to dwell opposite the orchard of delight, and he stationed the cheroubim and the flaming sword that turns, to guard the way of the tree of life.<verse eid="GEN 3:24"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:1"/>Now Adam knew his wife Heua, and after she had conceived she bore Kain and said, "I have acquired a man through God."<verse eid="GEN 4:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:2"/>And she proceeded to bear his brother Habel. And Habel became a herder of sheep, but Kain was tilling the earth.<verse eid="GEN 4:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:3"/>And it came about after some days that Kain brought to the Lord an offering of the fruits of the earth,<verse eid="GEN 4:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:4"/>and Habel, he also brought of the firstlings of his sheep and of their fat portions. And God looked upon Habel and upon his gifts,<verse eid="GEN 4:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:5"/>but on Kain and on his offerings he was not intent. And it distressed Kain exceedingly, and he collapsed in countenance.<verse eid="GEN 4:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:6"/>And the Lord God said to Kain, "Why have you become deeply grieved, and why has your countenance collapsed?<verse eid="GEN 4:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:7"/>If you offer correctly but do not divide correctly, have you not sinned? Be still; his<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'its'</char></note> recourse<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'return'</char></note> is to you, and you will<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'shall'</char></note> rule over him<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'it'</char></note>."<verse eid="GEN 4:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:8"/>And Kain said to his brother Habel, "Let us go through into the plain." And it came about when they were in the plain, that then Kain rose up against his brother Habel and killed him.<verse eid="GEN 4:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:9"/>And God said to Kain, "Where is your brother Habel?" And he said, "I do not know; surely I am not my brother's keeper?"<verse eid="GEN 4:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:10"/>And God said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the earth!<verse eid="GEN 4:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:11"/>And now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened wide its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.<verse eid="GEN 4:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:12"/>For you will till the earth, and it will not continue to yield its strength to you; you will be groaning and trembling on the earth."<verse eid="GEN 4:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:13"/>And Kain said to the Lord, "My guilt is too great for me to be forgiven!<verse eid="GEN 4:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:14"/>If today you are driving me out from off the earth and I shall be hidden from your face, then I shall be groaning and trembling on the earth, and it will be that anyone who finds me will kill me."<verse eid="GEN 4:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:15"/>And the Lord God said to him, "Not so! Anyone who kills Kain will let loose seven acts of vengeance." And the Lord God allocated a sign to Kain so that no one who found him would do away with him.<verse eid="GEN 4:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:16"/>Then Kain went away from the presence of God and lived in the land of Naid over against Edem.<verse eid="GEN 4:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:17"/>And Kain knew his wife, and after she had conceived she bore Henoch, and he was building a city and named the city after the name of his son Henoch.<verse eid="GEN 4:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:18"/>Then to Henoch was born Gaidad, and Gaidad was the father of Maiel, and Maiel the father of Mathousala, and Mathousala the father of Lamech.<verse eid="GEN 4:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:19"/>And Lamech took for himself two wives; the name of the one was Ada, and the name of the second was Sella.<verse eid="GEN 4:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:20"/>And Ada bore Iobel; he was the ancestor of cattle-raisers living in tents.<verse eid="GEN 4:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:21"/>And his brother's name was Ioubal; he was the one who introduced the harp and lyre.<verse eid="GEN 4:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:22"/>As for Sella, she also bore Thobel, and he was a smith, a forger of bronze and iron, and the sister of Thobel was Noema.<verse eid="GEN 4:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:23"/>Now Lamech said to his own wives: "Ada and Sella, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to my words, because I have killed a man for a wound to me, and<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:23</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'even'</char></note> a young man for a welt to me,<verse eid="GEN 4:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:24"/>because seven times vengeance has been exacted by Kain, but by Lamech seventy times seven."<verse eid="GEN 4:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:25"/>Now Adam knew his wife Heua, and after she had conceived she bore a son and named his name Seth, saying, "For God has raised up for me another offspring instead of Habel, whom Kain killed."<verse eid="GEN 4:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 4:26"/>And to Seth a son was born, and he named his name Enos. He hoped to invoke the name of the Lord God.<verse eid="GEN 4:26"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 6:3"/>And the Lord God said, "My spirit shall not abide in these humans forever, because they are flesh, but their days shall be one hundred twenty years."<verse eid="GEN 6:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:4"/>Now the giants were on the earth in those days and afterward. When the sons of God used to go in to the daughters of humans, then they produced offspring for themselves. Those were the giants that were of old, the renowned humans.<verse eid="GEN 6:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:5"/>And when the Lord God saw that the wicked deeds of humans were multiplied on the earth and that<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">6:5</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note> all think attentively in their hearts on evil things all the days,<verse eid="GEN 6:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:6"/>then God considered that he had made humankind on the earth, and he thought it over.<verse eid="GEN 6:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:7"/>And God said, "I will wipe out from off the earth humankind which I have made, from human to domestic animal and from creeping things to birds of the sky, for I have become angry that I have made them."<verse eid="GEN 6:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:8"/>Yet Noe found favor before the Lord God.<verse eid="GEN 6:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:9"/>Now these are the generations of Noe. Noe was a righteous man, being perfect in his era; Noe was well pleasing to God.<verse eid="GEN 6:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:10"/>And Noe had three sons: Sem, Cham, Iapheth.<verse eid="GEN 6:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:11"/>Now the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was full of wrongdoing.<verse eid="GEN 6:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:12"/>And the Lord God saw the earth, and it was ruined, for all flesh had ruined his way upon the earth.<verse eid="GEN 6:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:13"/>And God said to Noe, "The time of all humankind has come before me, for the earth has become full of wrongdoing by reason of them, and see, I am going to ruin them and the earth.<verse eid="GEN 6:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:14"/>Therefore make yourself an ark of squared lumber; you shall make the ark with nests and shall bituminize it within and without with bitumen.<verse eid="GEN 6:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:15"/>And thus you shall make the ark: the length of the ark three hundred cubits and the width fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits.<verse eid="GEN 6:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:16"/>You shall make the ark, bringing it together, and shall finish it to a cubit above, and the door you shall make in the side; you shall make it with ground floor, second story and third story chambers.<verse eid="GEN 6:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:17"/>And for my part, look, I am going to bring the flood, water on the earth, to destroy under heaven all flesh in which is a spirit of life, and as many as there are on the earth shall perish.<verse eid="GEN 6:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:18"/>And I will establish my covenant with you, and you shall come into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and your sons' wives together with you.<verse eid="GEN 6:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:19"/>And of all the domestic animals and of all the creeping things and of all the wild animals and of all flesh, you shall bring some of them all two by two into the ark in order to sustain them together with yourself; they shall be male and female.<verse eid="GEN 6:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:20"/>Of all the winged birds according to kind and of all the domestic animals according to kind and of all the creeping things that creep upon the ground according to their kind, two by two some of them all shall come in to you, to be sustained together with you, male and female.<verse eid="GEN 6:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:21"/>And you shall take for yourself some of all the provisions, which you will eat, and shall gather them to yourself, and they shall be for you and for them to eat."<verse eid="GEN 6:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 6:22"/>And Noe did all things that the Lord God commanded him; so he did.<verse eid="GEN 6:22"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:1"/>And the Lord God said to Noe, "Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen you as righteous before me in this generation.<verse eid="GEN 7:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:2"/>And bring in to you seven by seven some of the clean domestic animals, male and female, but two by two some of the domestic animals that are not clean, male and female,<verse eid="GEN 7:2"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 7:4"/>For within seven more days I am going to bring rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights, and every thing that rises up, which I have made, I will wipe out from the face of the earth."<verse eid="GEN 7:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:5"/>And Noe did all that the Lord God had commanded him.<verse eid="GEN 7:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:6"/>Now Noe was six hundred years of age, and the flood of water came on the earth.<verse eid="GEN 7:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:7"/>And Noe and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives went with him into the ark because of the water of the flood.<verse eid="GEN 7:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:8"/>And some of the birds and of the clean domestic animals and of the domestic animals that are not clean and of all the creeping things that are on the earth,<verse eid="GEN 7:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:9"/>two by two, male and female, went into the ark to Noe, as God had commanded him.<verse eid="GEN 7:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:10"/>And it came about after the seven days, that then the water of the flood came on the earth.<verse eid="GEN 7:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:11"/>In the six hundredth year in Noe's life, the second month, on the twenty-seventh of the month, on this day all the fountains of the abyss burst forth, and the cataracts of heaven were opened,<verse eid="GEN 7:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:12"/>and the rain came on the earth for forty days and forty nights.<verse eid="GEN 7:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:13"/>On this day Noe, Sem, Cham, Iapheth, Noe's sons, and Noe's wife and the three wives of his sons with him, entered into the ark.<verse eid="GEN 7:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:14"/>And all the wild animals according to kind and all the domestic animals according to kind and every creeping thing that moves on the earth according to kind and every bird according to kind<verse eid="GEN 7:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:15"/>entered into the ark to Noe, two by two of all flesh in which there is a spirit of life.<verse eid="GEN 7:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:16"/>And those that were coming in, male and female of all flesh, entered as God had commanded Noe.

    <verse sid="GEN 7:17"/>And the flood came for forty days and forty nights on the earth, and the water increased and bore up the ark, and it was raised up from the earth.<verse eid="GEN 7:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:18"/>And the water was prevailing and increasing greatly on the earth, and the ark was being carried along over the water.<verse eid="GEN 7:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:19"/>So the water was prevailing very greatly on the earth, and it covered all the high mountains that were under heaven;<verse eid="GEN 7:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:20"/>the water was raised up fifteen cubits above, and it covered all the high mountains.<verse eid="GEN 7:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:21"/>And all flesh that moves on the earth-- of birds and of domestic animals and of wild animals-- died, and every creeping thing that moves on the earth and every human being.<verse eid="GEN 7:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:22"/>And all things that have a breath of life, and everyone who was on the dry land, died.<verse eid="GEN 7:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:23"/>And he wiped out every thing that rises, which was on the face of the whole earth, from human being to domestic animal and creeping things and the birds of the sky, and they were wiped out from the earth. And only Noe was left, and those with him in the ark.<verse eid="GEN 7:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 7:24"/>And the water was raised up on the earth one hundred fifty days.<verse eid="GEN 7:24"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:1"/>And God remembered Noe and all the wild animals and all the domestic animals and all the birds and all the creeping things that were with him in the ark, and God brought a wind upon the earth, and the water subsided,<verse eid="GEN 8:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:2"/>and the fountains of the abyss and the cataracts of heaven were covered over, and the rain from heaven was restrained.<verse eid="GEN 8:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:3"/>And the water, as it was proceeding from the earth, was giving way; after fifty and one hundred days the water was giving way and diminishing.<verse eid="GEN 8:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:4"/>And in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh of the month, the ark settled on the mountains of Ararat.<verse eid="GEN 8:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:5"/>Now the water, as it was proceeding, was diminishing until the tenth month; then in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.<verse eid="GEN 8:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:6"/>And it came about after forty days that Noe opened the window of the ark that he had made<verse eid="GEN 8:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:7"/>and sent out the raven to see if the water had subsided, and after it had gone out it did not return until the water was dried up from the earth.<verse eid="GEN 8:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:8"/>And he sent out the dove after it to see if the water had subsided from the face of the earth.<verse eid="GEN 8:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:9"/>And the dove, because it could not find a resting place for its feet, returned to him into the ark, for water was on the whole face of the whole earth, and extending his hand he took it and brought it into the ark to himself.<verse eid="GEN 8:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:10"/>And when he had waited yet another seven days, again he sent forth the dove from the ark,<verse eid="GEN 8:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:11"/>and the dove went back to him toward evening, and it had an olive leaf, a dry twig, in its mouth, and Noe knew that the water had subsided from the earth.<verse eid="GEN 8:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:12"/>And when he had waited yet another seven days, again he sent forth the dove, and it did not continue to turn back to him any more.<verse eid="GEN 8:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:13"/>And it came about in the six hundred first year in the life of Noe, the first month, on the first of the month, that the water disappeared from the earth, and Noe uncovered the roof of the ark that he had made, and he saw that the water had disappeared from the face of the earth.<verse eid="GEN 8:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:14"/>Then in the second month, on the twenty-seventh of the month, the earth was dry.<verse eid="GEN 8:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:15"/>And the Lord God spoke to Noe, saying,<verse eid="GEN 8:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:16"/>"Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and your sons' wives with you,<verse eid="GEN 8:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:17"/>and bring out with yourself all the wild animals that are with you, and all flesh from birds to domestic animals and every creeping thing that moves on the earth, and increase, and multiply on the earth."<verse eid="GEN 8:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:18"/>And Noe went out, and his wife and his sons and his sons' wives with him,<verse eid="GEN 8:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:19"/>and all the wild animals and all the domestic animals and every bird and every creeping thing that moves on the earth went out of the ark according to their kind.<verse eid="GEN 8:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:20"/>And Noe built an altar to God and took of all the clean domestic animals and of all the clean birds and offered whole burnt offerings on the altar.<verse eid="GEN 8:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:21"/>And the Lord God smelled an odor of fragrance, and the Lord God, when he had given it thought, said, "I will not proceed hereafter to curse the earth because of the deeds of humans, for the mind of humankind applies itself attentively to evil things from youth; so I will not proceed hereafter to smite all living flesh, as I have done.<verse eid="GEN 8:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 8:22"/>During all the days of the earth, seed and harvest, cold and heat, summer and spring shall not cease-- during day and night."<verse eid="GEN 8:22"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:1"/>And God blessed Noe and his sons and said to them, "Increase, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it.<verse eid="GEN 9:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:2"/>And the trembling and fear of you shall be on all the animals of the earth and on all the birds of the sky and on all the things that move on the earth and on all the fish of the sea; I have given them under authority to you.<verse eid="GEN 9:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:3"/>And every creeping thing that is alive you shall have for food; like the pasture land herbs, I have given you all things.<verse eid="GEN 9:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:4"/>Only you shall not eat meat with the blood of life.<verse eid="GEN 9:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:5"/>For truly, your blood of your lives I will seek out: from the hand of all the animals I will seek it out, and from the hand of a fellow human I will seek out the life of the human.<verse eid="GEN 9:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:6"/>As for the one who sheds a human's blood, in return for this blood shall it<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'blood'</char></note> be shed. For by divine image I made humankind.<verse eid="GEN 9:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:7"/>But you, increase, and multiply, and fill the earth, and multiply on it."<verse eid="GEN 9:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:8"/>And God spoke to Noe and to his sons with him, saying,<verse eid="GEN 9:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:9"/>"As for me, see, I am instituting my covenant for you and your offspring after you<verse eid="GEN 9:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:10"/>and for every creature that lives with you, from birds and from domestic animals, and for all the animals of the earth, from all those that came out of the ark.<verse eid="GEN 9:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:11"/>And I will establish my covenant with you, and no more shall all flesh die by the water of the flood, and no more shall there be a flood of water to destroy all the earth."<verse eid="GEN 9:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:12"/>And the Lord God said to Noe, "This is the sign of the covenant, which<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the sign'</char></note> I give, between me and you and between every living creature that is with you, for everlasting generations:<verse eid="GEN 9:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:13"/>I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a covenant sign between me and the earth.<verse eid="GEN 9:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:14"/>And it shall be that when I gather clouds over the earth, my bow shall be seen in the cloud,<verse eid="GEN 9:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:15"/>and I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and between every living creature among all flesh, and the water shall no more become a flood so as to wipe out all flesh.<verse eid="GEN 9:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:16"/>And the bow shall be in the cloud, and I will see it to remember the everlasting covenant between me and between every living creature among all flesh that is on the earth."<verse eid="GEN 9:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:17"/>And God said to Noe, "This is the sign of the covenant that I have made between me and between all flesh that is on the earth."<verse eid="GEN 9:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:18"/>Now the sons of Noe who went out of the ark were Sem, Cham, Iapheth; Cham was the father of Chanaan.<verse eid="GEN 9:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:19"/>These three are the sons of Noe; from these they<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'people'</char></note> were scattered abroad over the whole earth.<verse eid="GEN 9:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:20"/>And Noe was the first soil-tilling person, and he planted a vineyard.<verse eid="GEN 9:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:21"/>And he drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he was stripped naked in his house.<verse eid="GEN 9:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:22"/>And Cham, the father of Chanaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and after he had gone out he told his two brothers outside.<verse eid="GEN 9:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:23"/>And Sem and Iapheth, when they had taken the garment, laid it on their two backs and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father, and their face was looking backward, and they did not see their father's nakedness.<verse eid="GEN 9:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:24"/>Then Noe sobered up from the wine, and he knew what his younger son had done to him,<verse eid="GEN 9:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:25"/>and he said, "Cursed be Chanaan; a slave, a domestic, shall he be to his brothers."<verse eid="GEN 9:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:26"/>He also said, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Sem, and Chanaan shall be his slave.<verse eid="GEN 9:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:27"/>May God make space for Iapheth, and let him live in the houses of Sem, and let Chanaan become their slave."<verse eid="GEN 9:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:28"/>Now after the flood Noe lived three hundred fifty years.<verse eid="GEN 9:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 9:29"/>And all the days of Noe amounted to nine hundred fifty years, and he died.<verse eid="GEN 9:29"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:1"/>Now these are the generations of Noe's sons, Sem, Cham, Iapheth, and sons were born to them after the flood.<verse eid="GEN 10:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:2"/>The sons of Iapheth: Gamer and Magog and Madai and Ioyan and Elisa and Thobel and Mosoch and Thiras.<verse eid="GEN 10:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:3"/>And the sons of Gamer: Aschanaz and Riphath and Thorgama.<verse eid="GEN 10:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:4"/>And the sons of Ioyan: Elisa and Tharsis, Kitians, Rhodians.<verse eid="GEN 10:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:5"/>From these the islands of the nations were separated in their land, each according to language, in their tribes and in their nations.<verse eid="GEN 10:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:6"/>And the sons of Cham: Chous and Mesraim, Phoud and Chanaan.<verse eid="GEN 10:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:7"/>And the sons of Chous: Saba and Heuila and Sabatha and Regma and Sabakatha. And the sons of Regma: Saba and Dadan.<verse eid="GEN 10:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:8"/>Now Chous became the father of Nebrod. He was the first on earth to be a giant.<verse eid="GEN 10:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:9"/>He was a giant hunter before the Lord God; therefore they will say, "Like Nebrod a giant hunter before the Lord."<verse eid="GEN 10:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:10"/>And the beginning of his kingdom came to be Babylon, Orech and Archad and Chalanne in the land of Sennaar.<verse eid="GEN 10:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:11"/>From that land he went forth to Assour and built Nineue and Rooboth-city and Kalach,<verse eid="GEN 10:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:12"/>and Dasem between Nineue and between Kalach; this is the great city.<verse eid="GEN 10:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:13"/>And Mesraim became the father of the Loudieim and the Enemetieim and the Labieim and the Nephthalieim<verse eid="GEN 10:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:14"/>and the Patrosonieim and the Chaslonieim, there where Phylistieim came from, and the Kaphthorieim.<verse eid="GEN 10:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:15"/>Now Chanaan became the father of Sidon as his firstborn and the Chettite<verse eid="GEN 10:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:16"/>and the Iebousite and the Amorrite and the Gergesite<verse eid="GEN 10:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:17"/>and the Heuite and the Aroukite and the Hasennite<verse eid="GEN 10:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:18"/>and the Aradian and the Samarite and Hamathi. And afterward the tribes of the Chananites were scattered abroad.<verse eid="GEN 10:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:19"/>And the boundaries of the Chananites extended from Sidon until one came to Gerara and Gaza, until one came as far as Sodoma and Gomorra, Adama and Seboim, as far as Lasa.<verse eid="GEN 10:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:20"/>These are the sons of Cham, in their tribes, according to their languages, in their countries and in their nations.<verse eid="GEN 10:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:21"/>And to Sem, also to him as father of all the sons of Eber, brother of Iapheth the Greater, there was procreation.<verse eid="GEN 10:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:22"/>The sons of Sem: Ailam and As-sour and Arphaxad and Loud and Aramaic and Kainan.<verse eid="GEN 10:22"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 10:24"/>And Arphaxad became the father of Kainan, and Kainan became the father of Sala; then Sala became the father of Eber.<verse eid="GEN 10:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:25"/>And to Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Phalek, for in his days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Iektan.<verse eid="GEN 10:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:26"/>Now Iektan became the father of Elmodad and Saleph and Hasarmoth and Iarach<verse eid="GEN 10:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:27"/>and Hodorra and Aizel and Dekla<verse eid="GEN 10:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:28"/>and Abimeel and Sabeu<verse eid="GEN 10:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:29"/>and Ouphir and Heuila and Iobab. All these were the sons of Iektan.<verse eid="GEN 10:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:30"/>And their abode extended from Masse until one came to Sophera, a mountain of the east.<verse eid="GEN 10:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:31"/>These are the sons of Sem, in their tribes, according to their languages, in their countries and in their nations.<verse eid="GEN 10:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 10:32"/>These are the tribes of Noe's sons, according to their generations, according to their nations; from these the islands of the nations were scattered abroad on the earth after the flood.<verse eid="GEN 10:32"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:1"/>And the whole earth was one lip, and there was one speech for all.<verse eid="GEN 11:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:2"/>And it came about as they moved from the east that they found a plain in the land of Sennaar and settled there.<verse eid="GEN 11:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:3"/>And one person said to the next, "Come, let us make bricks and bake them with fire." And the brick became stone for them, and the clay for them was bitumen.<verse eid="GEN 11:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:4"/>And they said, "Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower whose top shall be as far as heaven, and let us make a name for ourselves before we are scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth."<verse eid="GEN 11:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:5"/>And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the sons of men had built.<verse eid="GEN 11:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:6"/>And the Lord said, "Look, one race and one lip of all, and this they have begun to do, and nothing that they undertake to do will now be wanting from them.<verse eid="GEN 11:6"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 11:8"/>And the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city and the tower.<verse eid="GEN 11:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:9"/>Therefore its name was called Confusion, because there the Lord confused the lips of all the earth, and from there the Lord God scattered them abroad over the face of all the earth.<verse eid="GEN 11:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:10"/>And these are the generations of Sem: Sem was a son of one hundred years when he became the father of Arphaxad, in the second year after the flood.<verse eid="GEN 11:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:11"/>And Sem lived after he became the father of Arphaxad five hundred years and had sons and daughters and died.<verse eid="GEN 11:11"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 11:26"/>And Thara lived seventy years and became the father of Abram and Nachor and Harran.<verse eid="GEN 11:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:27"/>These then are the generations of Thara: Thara was the father of Abram and Nachor and Harran, and Harran was the father of Lot.<verse eid="GEN 11:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:28"/>And Harran died before his father Thara in the land in which he was born, in the country of the Chaldeans.<verse eid="GEN 11:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:29"/>And Abram and Nachor took wives for themselves; Abram's wife's name was Sara, and Nachor's wife's name was Melcha, the daughter of Harran, the father of Melcha and the father of Iescha.<verse eid="GEN 11:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:30"/>And Sara was barren, and she was not bearing children.<verse eid="GEN 11:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:31"/>And Thara took his son Abram and his son's son, Lot son of Harran, and his daughter-in-law Sara, his son Abram's wife, and he brought them out of the country of the Chaldeans to go into the land of Chanaan, and he came as far as Charran and settled there.<verse eid="GEN 11:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 11:32"/>And the days of Thara in Char-ran amounted to two hundred five years, and Thara died in Charran.<verse eid="GEN 11:32"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:1"/>And the Lord said to Abram, "Go forth from your country and from your kindred and from your father's house to the land that I will show you.<verse eid="GEN 12:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:2"/>And I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, and you shall be one blessed.<verse eid="GEN 12:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:3"/>And I will bless those who bless you, and those who curse you I will curse, and in you all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed."<verse eid="GEN 12:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:4"/>And Abram went, as the Lord had told him to, and Lot left with him. Now Abram was seventy-five years of age when he departed from Charran.<verse eid="GEN 12:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:5"/>And Abram took his wife Sara and his brother's son Lot and all their possessions that they had acquired and every person whom they had acquired in Charran, and they departed to go to the land of Chanaan, and they came to the land of Chanaan.<verse eid="GEN 12:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:6"/>And Abram passed through the land in its length as far as the place Sychem, at the high oak. Now at that time the Chananites used to inhabit the land.<verse eid="GEN 12:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:7"/>And the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, "To your offspring I will give this land." And Abram built there an altar to the Lord who had appeared to him.<verse eid="GEN 12:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:8"/>And from there he withdrew to the mountain to the east of Baithel and set up his tent there-- Baithel towards the sea and Haggai to the east, and there he built an altar to the Lord and called on the name of the Lord.<verse eid="GEN 12:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:9"/>And Abram set out, and as he traveled he encamped in the wilderness.<verse eid="GEN 12:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:10"/>And a famine occurred upon the land, and Abram went down to Egypt to reside there as an alien, for the famine prevailed upon the land.<verse eid="GEN 12:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:11"/>And it came about when Abram drew near to enter into Egypt that Abram said to his wife Sara, "I do know that you are a woman beautiful in countenance;<verse eid="GEN 12:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:12"/>it will be, therefore, that should the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife,' and they will kill me, but you they will keep for themselves.<verse eid="GEN 12:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:13"/>Say, therefore, 'I am his sister,' so that it may go well with me because of you, and my soul will live on your account."<verse eid="GEN 12:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:14"/>And it came about when Abram entered into Egypt-- as the Egyptians saw the woman, that she was very beautiful--<verse eid="GEN 12:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:15"/>that then the rulers of Pharao saw her and praised her to Pharao and brought her into Pharao's house.<verse eid="GEN 12:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:16"/>And for her sake they dealt well with Abram, and he had sheep and calves and donkeys, male and female slaves, mules and camels.<verse eid="GEN 12:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:17"/>And God tried Pharao and his house with great and grievous trials because of Sara, Abram's wife.<verse eid="GEN 12:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:18"/>Now when Pharao had called Abram he said, "What is this you have done to me, that you did not tell me that she is your wife?<verse eid="GEN 12:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:19"/>Why did you say, 'She is my sister'? And I took her to myself for a wife. And now here is your wife before you; take her; hurry off."<verse eid="GEN 12:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 12:20"/>And Pharao commanded men concerning Abram to join in escorting him and his wife and all that he had and Lot with him.<verse eid="GEN 12:20"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:1"/>Then Abram went up from Egypt, he and his wife and all that was his and Lot with him, into the wilderness.<verse eid="GEN 13:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:2"/>Now Abram was very rich in livestock and in silver and in gold.<verse eid="GEN 13:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:3"/>And he journeyed whence he had come into the wilderness as far as Baithel, to the place where formerly his tent had been, between Baithel and between Haggai,<verse eid="GEN 13:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:4"/>to the place of the altar that he had made there at first, and there Abram invoked the name of the Lord.<verse eid="GEN 13:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:5"/>And Lot, who was journeying together with Abram, had sheep and cattle and tents.<verse eid="GEN 13:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:6"/>And the land did not have room for them to live together, for their possessions were many, and they could not live together.<verse eid="GEN 13:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:7"/>And strife occurred between the herders of Abram's livestock and between the herders of Lot's livestock. Now at that time the Chananites and the Pherezites used to inhabit the land.<verse eid="GEN 13:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:8"/>So then Abram said to Lot, "Let there not be strife between you and me and between your herders and my herders, for we are kindred.<verse eid="GEN 13:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:9"/>See, is not the whole land before you? Separate yourself from me. If you go<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">13:9</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'will go': Lacking in Greek</char></note> to the left, I will go<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">13:9</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'will go': Lacking in Greek</char></note> to the right, but if you go<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">13:9</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'go': Lacking in Greek</char></note> to the right, I will go<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">13:9</char><char closed="false" style="ft">null</char></note> to the left."<verse eid="GEN 13:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:10"/>And Lot, lifting up his eyes, saw all the region round about the Jordan, that all was watered-- before God had overthrown Sodoma and Gomorra-- like the orchard of God and like the land of Egypt until one came to Zogora.<verse eid="GEN 13:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:11"/>And Lot chose for himself all the region round about the Jordan, and Lot set out from the east, and they separated, each one from his kinsman.<verse eid="GEN 13:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:12"/>So then Abram settled in the land of Chanaan, but Lot settled in a city of the regions<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">13:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'peoples'</char></note> round about and tented in Sodoma.<verse eid="GEN 13:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:13"/>Now the people who were in Sodoma were wicked and exceedingly sinful before God.<verse eid="GEN 13:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:14"/>And God said to Abram after Lot had separated from him, "Look up with your eyes; look from the place where you are now, toward the north and southwest and east and sea.<verse eid="GEN 13:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:15"/>For all the land that you see, I will give it to you and to your offspring forever.<verse eid="GEN 13:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:16"/>And I will make your offspring like the sand of the earth; if anyone can count the sand of the earth, your offspring also shall be counted.<verse eid="GEN 13:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:17"/>Rise up, pass through the land, both in the length of it and in the breadth, for I will give it to you."<verse eid="GEN 13:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 13:18"/>And moving his tent, Abram came and settled by the oak of Mambre, which was in Chebron, and there he built an altar to the Lord.<verse eid="GEN 13:18"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:1"/>Now it came about in the kingship of Amarphal king of Sennaar, that Arioch king of Ellasar and Chodollogomor king of Ailam and Thargal king of nations<verse eid="GEN 14:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:2"/>made war with Bara king of Sodoma and with Barsa king of Gomorra and Sennaar king of Adama and Symobor king of Seboim and the king of Bala (this is Segor).<verse eid="GEN 14:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:3"/>All these made an agreement at the salt ravine (this is the sea of salt).<verse eid="GEN 14:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:4"/>Twelve years they were subject to Chodollogomor, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.<verse eid="GEN 14:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:5"/>Then in the fourteenth year Chodollogomor and the kings who were with him came and cut down the giants who were in Astaroth Karnain and strong nations together with them and the Ommites who were in the city Saue<verse eid="GEN 14:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:6"/>and the Chorrites who were in the mountains of Seir, as far as the terebinth of Pharan which is in the wilderness.<verse eid="GEN 14:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:7"/>And after they had turned back they came to the spring of judgment (this is Kades) and cut down all the rulers of Amalek and the Amorrites who live in Hasasan Thamar.<verse eid="GEN 14:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:8"/>Then the king of Sodoma and the king of Gomorra and the king of Adama and the king of Seboim and the king of Bala (this is Segor) went out, and they drew up in battle array with them for war in the salt valley,<verse eid="GEN 14:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:9"/>against Chodollogomor king of Ailam and Thargal king of nations and Amarphal king of Sennaar and Arioch king of Ellasar, four kings against five.<verse eid="GEN 14:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:10"/>Now the salt valley was pits, pits of bitumen, and the king of Sodoma and the king of Gomorra fled and fell in there, but those who were left fled to the hill country.<verse eid="GEN 14:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:11"/>Then they<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">14:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the four kings'</char></note> took all the cavalry of Sodoma and Gomorra and all their provisions and went away.<verse eid="GEN 14:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:12"/>And they also took Lot, the son of Abram's brother, and his chattels and departed, for he was living in Sodoma.<verse eid="GEN 14:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:13"/>And one of those who had been rescued, when he arrived, told Abram the emigrant. Now he, Amoris, used to live near the oak of Mambre, the brother of Eschol and brother of Aunan, who were confederates of Abram.<verse eid="GEN 14:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:14"/>And when Abram heard that his kinsman Lot had been taken captive, he counted his own homebreds, three hundred eighteen, and chased after them as far as Dan.<verse eid="GEN 14:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:15"/>And he fell upon them during the night, he and his servants, and smote them and chased them away to Choba, which is on the left of Damascus.<verse eid="GEN 14:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:16"/>Then he brought back all the cavalry of Sodoma, and he brought back his kinsman Lot and his possessions and the women and the people.<verse eid="GEN 14:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:17"/>Now after he had returned from the slaughter of Chodollogomor and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodoma went out to meet him at the valley of Saue (this was the plain of a king).<verse eid="GEN 14:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:18"/>And Melchisedek king of Salem brought out bread loaves and wine; now he was priest of God Most High.<verse eid="GEN 14:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:19"/>And he blessed Abram and said, "Blessed be Abram to God Most High, who created the heaven and the earth,<verse eid="GEN 14:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:20"/>and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered up your enemies as subjects to you!" And he<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">14:20</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'Abram'</char></note> gave him one tenth of everything.<verse eid="GEN 14:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:21"/>Then the king of Sodoma said to Abram, "Give me the men, but take the cavalry for yourself."<verse eid="GEN 14:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:22"/>But Abram said to the king of Sodoma, "I will extend my hand to God Most High, who created the heaven and the earth:<verse eid="GEN 14:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:23"/>if I shall take from a small cord to a sandal-thong of all the things that are yours-- lest you say, 'I have made Abram rich,'<verse eid="GEN 14:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 14:24"/>except the things that the young men have eaten and the share of the men who went along with me-- Eschol, Aunan, Mambre-- these shall take a share."<verse eid="GEN 14:24"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:1"/>Now after these matters the Lord's word came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Do not be afraid, Abram; I am shielding you; your reward shall be very great."<verse eid="GEN 15:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:2"/>But Abram was saying, "O Master, what will you give me? And I, I am going away childless; as for the son of Masek, my female homebred, he is Damascus Eliezer."<verse eid="GEN 15:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:3"/>And Abram said, "Since you have given me no offspring, my male homebred will be my heir."<verse eid="GEN 15:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:4"/>And immediately a divine voice came to him, saying, "This one shall not be your heir, but one who shall come out of you, he shall be your heir."<verse eid="GEN 15:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:5"/>Then he brought him outside and said to him, "Look up to heaven, and number the stars, if you will be able to count them." And he said, "So shall your offspring be."<verse eid="GEN 15:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:6"/>And Abram believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.<verse eid="GEN 15:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:7"/>Then he said to him, "I am the God who brought you out of the country of the Chaldeans so as to give you this land to possess."<verse eid="GEN 15:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:8"/>But he said, "O Master, Lord, how shall I know that I shall possess it?"<verse eid="GEN 15:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:9"/>And he said to him, "Take for me a heifer three years old and a female goat three years old and a ram three years old and a turtledove and a dove."<verse eid="GEN 15:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:10"/>And he took for him all these and divided them in the middle and placed them facing one another, but he did not divide the birds.<verse eid="GEN 15:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:11"/>And birds came down on the carcasses, their cut halves, and Abram sat together with them.<verse eid="GEN 15:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:12"/>Then about sunset a trance fell upon Abram, and look, a great dark fear was falling upon him.<verse eid="GEN 15:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:13"/>And it was said to Abram, "Knowledgeably you shall know that your offspring shall be alien in a land not its own, and they<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">15:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="GEN 15:14"/>But I will judge the nation that they are subject to; then afterward they shall come out here with much baggage.<verse eid="GEN 15:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:15"/>Now as for yourself, you shall depart to your fathers in peace, buried in a good old age.<verse eid="GEN 15:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:16"/>Then in the fourth generation they shall be brought back here, for the sins of the Amorrites are not yet, to the present, filled up."<verse eid="GEN 15:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:17"/>Now after the sun began to appear in the west, a flame appeared, and look, a smoking oven and torches of fire that passed through between these cut halves.<verse eid="GEN 15:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:18"/>On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your offspring I will give this land from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:<verse eid="GEN 15:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:19"/>the Kenites and the Kenezites and the Kedmonites<verse eid="GEN 15:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:20"/>and the Chettites and the Pherezites and the Rhaphain<verse eid="GEN 15:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 15:21"/>and the Amorrites and the Chananites and the Heuites and the Gergesites and the Iebousites."<verse eid="GEN 15:21"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:1"/>Now Sara, Abram's wife, was not giving birth for him. She, however, had an Egyptian slave-girl whose name was Hagar.<verse eid="GEN 16:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:2"/>And Sara said to Abram, "See, the Lord has shut me off from giving birth; so go in to my slave-girl in order that you may beget children by her." And Abram listened to the voice of Sara.<verse eid="GEN 16:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:3"/>And after ten years of Abram's living in the land of Chanaan, Sara, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her own slave-girl, and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife for him.<verse eid="GEN 16:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:4"/>And he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And she saw that she was pregnant, and her mistress was dishonored before her.<verse eid="GEN 16:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:5"/>Then Sara said to Abram, "I am being wronged due to you! I have given my slave-girl into your bosom, but when she saw that she was pregnant, I was dishonored before her. May God judge between you and me!"<verse eid="GEN 16:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:6"/>But Abram said to Sara, "See, your slave-girl is in your hands; treat her as it may please you." And Sara maltreated her, and she ran from her presence.<verse eid="GEN 16:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:7"/>But the Lord God's angel found her by the spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Sour.<verse eid="GEN 16:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:8"/>And the angel of the Lord said to her, "Hagar, slave-girl of Sara, where are you coming from, and where are you going?" And she said, "I am running from the presence of my mistress Sara."<verse eid="GEN 16:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:9"/>But the angel of the Lord said to her, "Return to your mistress, and humble yourself under her hands."<verse eid="GEN 16:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:10"/>The angel of the Lord also said to her, "I will multitudinously multiply your off-spring, and it will not be counted for multitude."<verse eid="GEN 16:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:11"/>And the angel of the Lord said to her, "See, you are pregnant and shall bear a son and shall call his name Ismael. For the Lord has given heed to your humiliation.<verse eid="GEN 16:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:12"/>He shall be a rustic man; his hands shall be<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'shall be':  Lacking in Greek</char></note> against all, and the hands of all against him, and he shall live facing all his kinfolk."<verse eid="GEN 16:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:13"/>And Hagar called the name of the Lord who was speaking to her, "You-are-the-God-who-looks-upon-me," because she said, "For truly I saw him face to face when he appeared to me."<verse eid="GEN 16:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 16:14"/>Therefore she called the well, "Well-of-the-one-whom-I-saw-face-to-face"; see, it is<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">16:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'it is':  Lacking in Greek</char></note> between Kades and between Barad.<verse eid="GEN 16:14"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 16:16"/>And Abram was eighty-six years of age when Hagar bore Abram Ismael.<verse eid="GEN 16:16"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:1"/>Now Abram came to be ninety-nine years of age, and the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am your God; be well pleasing before me, and become blameless,<verse eid="GEN 17:1"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 17:12"/>And a youngster of eight days shall be circumcised among you-- every male-- throughout your generations, the homebred of your household and the one bought with money from any son of a foreigner, who is not of your offspring.<verse eid="GEN 17:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:13"/>The homebred of your household and the one bought with money shall be circumcised with circumcision, and my covenant shall be on your flesh for an everlasting covenant.<verse eid="GEN 17:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:14"/>And as for an uncircumcised male who shall not be circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin on the eighth day, that soul shall be destroyed from his kin, for he has scattered my covenant."<verse eid="GEN 17:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:15"/>And God said to Abraam, "As for Sara your wife, her name shall not be called Sara, but Sarra shall be her name.<verse eid="GEN 17:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:16"/>And I will bless her, and I will give you a child by her. And I will bless her, and she shall become nations, and kings of nations shall be from her."<verse eid="GEN 17:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:17"/>And Abraam fell face down and laughed and spoke in his mind, saying, "Shall a son be born to a hundred-year-old, and shall Sarra who is ninety years of age give birth?"<verse eid="GEN 17:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:18"/>And Abraam said to God, "As for Ismael, let him live before you!"<verse eid="GEN 17:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:19"/>But God said to Abraam, "Indeed; see, your wife Sarra shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name Isaak, and I will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant and for his offspring after him.<verse eid="GEN 17:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:20"/>Now concerning Ismael, see, I heard you; see, I have blessed him and will make him increase and will make him very numerous; he shall be the father of twelve nations, and I will appoint him as a great nation.<verse eid="GEN 17:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:21"/>But my covenant I will establish with Isaak, whom Sarra shall bear to you at this season in another year."<verse eid="GEN 17:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:22"/>And he finished talking to him, and God went up from Abraam.<verse eid="GEN 17:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:23"/>And Abraam took his son Ismael and all his homebreds and all the ones bought with money and every male of the men that were in Abraam's house, and he circumcised their foreskins at the opportune time of that day, as God had said to him.<verse eid="GEN 17:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:24"/>Now Abraam was ninety-nine years of age when he circumcised the flesh of his foreskin.<verse eid="GEN 17:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:25"/>And his son Ismael was thirteen years of age when he was circumcised in the flesh of his fore-skin.<verse eid="GEN 17:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:26"/>At the opportune time of that day Abraam and his son Ismael were circumcised,<verse eid="GEN 17:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 17:27"/>and as for all the men of his house and the homebreds and the ones bought with money from alien nations, he circumcised them.<verse eid="GEN 17:27"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:1"/>Now God appeared to him near the oak of Mambre, while he was sitting at the door of his tent at midday.<verse eid="GEN 18:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:2"/>And looking up with his eyes he saw, and see, three men stood over him. And when he saw them, he ran forward from his tent door to meet them and did obeisance upon the ground<verse eid="GEN 18:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:3"/>and said, "Lord, if perchance I have found favor before you, do not pass by your servant.<verse eid="GEN 18:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:4"/>Do let water be taken, and let them wash your feet, and you cool off under the tree.<verse eid="GEN 18:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:5"/>And I shall take bread, and you will eat, and after that you will pass by on your way-- inasmuch as you have turned aside to your servant." And they said, "So do, as you have said."<verse eid="GEN 18:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:6"/>And Abraam hurried over to the tent to Sarra and said to her, "Hurry, and mix three measures of fine flour, and make loaves baked in ashes."<verse eid="GEN 18:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:7"/>And Abraam ran to the cows and took a little calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, and he hastened to prepare it.<verse eid="GEN 18:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:8"/>Then he took butter and milk and the little calf that he had prepared and set it before them, and they ate, and he stood by them under the tree.<verse eid="GEN 18:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:9"/>And he said to him, "Where is your wife Sarra?" And he said in reply, "There, in the tent."<verse eid="GEN 18:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:10"/>And he said, "I will come to you, when I return, during this season next year, and Sarra your wife shall have a son." And Sarra, who was behind him, listened at the tent door.<verse eid="GEN 18:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:11"/>Now Abraam and Sarra were old, advanced in days, and menstruation had ceased to happen to Sarra.<verse eid="GEN 18:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:12"/>And Sarra laughed within herself, saying, "It has not yet happened to me up to the present, and my lord is rather old."<verse eid="GEN 18:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:13"/>And the Lord said to Abraam, "Why is it that Sarra laughed within herself, saying, 'Shall I then indeed give birth? But I have grown old.'<verse eid="GEN 18:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:14"/>Can it be that a matter is impossible with God? In this season I will come back to you next year, and Sarra shall have a son."<verse eid="GEN 18:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:15"/>But Sarra denied, saying, "I did not laugh," for she was afraid. And he said, "No, but you did laugh."<verse eid="GEN 18:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:16"/>And when the men had set out from there, they looked down upon the face of Sodoma and Gomorra, and Abraam was going along with them as he joined in escorting them.<verse eid="GEN 18:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:17"/>And the Lord said, "Surely I shall not hide from my servant Abraam what I am about to do?<verse eid="GEN 18:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:18"/>As for Abraam, he shall come to be a great and populous nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him.<verse eid="GEN 18:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:19"/>For I knew that he will instruct his sons and his household after him, and they will keep the ways of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice so that the Lord may bring upon Abraam all the things that he has talked about to him."<verse eid="GEN 18:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:20"/>Then the Lord said, "The outcry concerning Sodoma and Gomorra has been increased, and their sins are very great!<verse eid="GEN 18:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:21"/>So when I go down I shall see whether they are perpetrating according to the outcry concerning them that is coming to me, but if not-- that I may know."<verse eid="GEN 18:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:22"/>And after the men had turned away from there, they went to Sodoma, but Abraam was still standing before the Lord.<verse eid="GEN 18:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:23"/>Then when Abraam had come near, he said, "Surely you will not destroy the righteous with the ungodly, and the righteous will be as the ungodly?<verse eid="GEN 18:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:24"/>If there should be fifty righteous in the city, will you destroy them? Will you not let the whole place go free on account of the fifty righteous, if they should be in it?<verse eid="GEN 18:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:25"/>By no means will you do anything like this thing, to slay the righteous with the ungodly, and the righteous will be like the ungodly! By no means! Shall not you, the one who judges all the earth, do what is just?"<verse eid="GEN 18:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:26"/>Then the Lord said, "If I find in Sodoma fifty righteous in the city, I will forgive the whole place for their sake."<verse eid="GEN 18:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:27"/>And Abraam said in reply, "Now I have begun to speak to the Lord, though I am earth and ashes.<verse eid="GEN 18:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:28"/>But if the fifty righteous should be diminished by five, will you destroy the whole city on account of the five?" And he said, "I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there."<verse eid="GEN 18:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:29"/>And he continued still to speak to him and said, "But if forty should be found there?" And he said, "On account of the forty I will not destroy it."<verse eid="GEN 18:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:30"/>And he said, "Pardon, Lord, if I should speak. But if thirty should be found there?" And he said, "I will not destroy it, if I find thirty there."<verse eid="GEN 18:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:31"/>And he said, "Since I am compelled to speak to the Lord-- and if twenty should be found there?" And he said, "On account of the twenty I will not destroy it."<verse eid="GEN 18:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:32"/>And he said, "Pardon, Lord, if I should speak once more. But if ten should be found there?" And he said, "On account of the ten I will not destroy it."<verse eid="GEN 18:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 18:33"/>Then the Lord went away, when he had left off speaking to Abraam, and Abraam returned to his place.<verse eid="GEN 18:33"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:1"/>Now the two angels came to Sodoma at evening, and Lot was sitting beside the gate of Sodoma. And when Lot saw them he rose to meet them and did obeisance with his face upon the ground<verse eid="GEN 19:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:2"/>and said, "Here, lords, turn aside to your servant's house, and find lodging, and wash your feet, and when you have risen early you will depart on your way." They, however, said, "No, but we will find lodging in the street."<verse eid="GEN 19:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:3"/>And he kept constraining them, and they turned aside to him and entered into his dwelling. And he made them a feast and baked them unleavened loaves, and they ate (4) before they lay down.<verse eid="GEN 19:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:4"/>And the men of the city, the Sodomites, from young man to elder, all the people together, encircled the dwelling,<verse eid="GEN 19:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:5"/>and they were summoning Lot and were saying to him, "Where are the men who came in to you tonight? Bring them out to us in order that we may have relations with them."<verse eid="GEN 19:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:6"/>And Lot went out to the doorway to them, but he shut the door after him.<verse eid="GEN 19:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:7"/>And he said to them, "By no means, brothers, do not act wickedly.<verse eid="GEN 19:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:8"/>Now I have two daughters who have not known a man. I shall bring them out to you, and use them as it may please you; only do not do anything unjust to these men, inasmuch as they have come in under the shelter of my beams."<verse eid="GEN 19:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:9"/>But they said, "Stand away from there! As one, you came to reside as an alien. Surely not also to pass judgment? So now we will maltreat you rather than them." And they were pressing the man Lot very hard and came near to smash the door.<verse eid="GEN 19:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:10"/>But the men, extending their hands, drew Lot into the house to themselves and shut the door of the house.<verse eid="GEN 19:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:11"/>And they struck with blindness the men who were at the door of the house, from small to great, and they became exhausted searching for the door.<verse eid="GEN 19:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:12"/>Then the men said to Lot, "Have you anyone here, sons-in-law or sons or daughters? Or if you have anyone else in the city, bring that one out of this place.<verse eid="GEN 19:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:13"/>For we are about to destroy this place, because the outcry concerning them<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">19:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the inhabitants'</char></note> has been raised before the Lord, and the Lord has sent us to annihilate it<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">19:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the city'</char></note>."<verse eid="GEN 19:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:14"/>Then Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law who had married his daughters and said, "Rise, and get out of this place, for the Lord is about to annihilate the city." But he seemed before his sons-in-law to be jesting.<verse eid="GEN 19:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:15"/>Now when dawn was breaking, the angels were urging Lot, saying, "Rise, take your wife and the two daughters whom you have, and get out, lest you also be destroyed together with the lawlessness of the city."<verse eid="GEN 19:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:16"/>And they were confounded, and the angels seized his hand and his wife's hand and his two daughters' hands, as the Lord spared him.<verse eid="GEN 19:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:17"/>And it came about when they had brought them outside, that then they said, "In saving, save your own soul; do not look around backwards or stop in the whole region round about; get safely to the mountain, that you not be included."<verse eid="GEN 19:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:18"/>But Lot said to them, "I pray, Lord,<verse eid="GEN 19:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:19"/>since your servant has found mercy before you and you have magnified your righteousness-- that which you bring about with regard to me-- to quicken my soul, but I shall not be able to proceed safely to the mountain, for fear the disasters overtake me and I die;<verse eid="GEN 19:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:20"/>look, this city, which is small, is near enough for me to flee for refuge there; I shall escape there. Is it not small? And my soul will live!"<verse eid="GEN 19:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:21"/>And he said to him, "Look, I have indulged your person also in reference to this matter, not to overthrow the city concerning which you have spoken.<verse eid="GEN 19:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:22"/>So hurry to escape there, for I shall not be able to do a thing until you enter there." Therefore he called the name of the city Segor.<verse eid="GEN 19:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:23"/>The sun came out on the earth, and Lot entered into Segor,<verse eid="GEN 19:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:24"/>and the Lord rained on Sodoma and Gomorra sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven,<verse eid="GEN 19:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:25"/>and he overthrew these cities and all the neighboring region and all the inhabitants in the cities and all the things that grow up out of the earth.<verse eid="GEN 19:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:26"/>And his wife gazed backwards, and she became a stele of salt.<verse eid="GEN 19:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:27"/>And Abraam started early in the morning for the place where he had stood before the Lord,<verse eid="GEN 19:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:28"/>and he gazed upon the face of Sodoma and Gomorra and upon the face of the land of the region round about and saw, and see, the flame of the land was going up like the vapor of a furnace.<verse eid="GEN 19:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:29"/>And it came about when God annihilated all the cities of the neighboring region that God remembered Abraam and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow when the Lord overthrew the cities which Lot used to dwell in.<verse eid="GEN 19:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:30"/>Now Lot went up out of Segor and settled in the mountain, and his two daughters with him, for he was afraid to dwell in Segor. And he lived in the cave, he and his two daughters with him.<verse eid="GEN 19:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:31"/>Now the elder said to the younger, "Our father is elderly, and there is no one on the earth who will come in to us, as is fitting in all the world.<verse eid="GEN 19:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:32"/>Come, and let us give our father wine to drink, and let us lie with him and raise up offspring from our father."<verse eid="GEN 19:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:33"/>And they gave their father wine to drink on this night, and the elder, when she had gone in, lay with her father that night, and he did not know when she lay down and got up.<verse eid="GEN 19:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:34"/>And it came about on the next day that then the elder said to the younger, "Look, I lay yesterday with our father; let us give him wine to drink this night also, and when you have gone in, lie with him, and let us raise up offspring from our father."<verse eid="GEN 19:34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:35"/>And they gave their father wine to drink on that night also, and the younger, when she had gone in, lay with her father, and he did not know when she lay down and got up.<verse eid="GEN 19:35"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:36"/>And the two daughters of Lot became pregnant by their father.<verse eid="GEN 19:36"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:37"/>And the elder bore a son and called his name Moab: "From my father"; he is the ancestor of the Moabites to the present day.<verse eid="GEN 19:37"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 19:38"/>And the younger bore a son too and called his name Amman: "Son of my race"; he is the ancestor of the Ammanites to the present day.<verse eid="GEN 19:38"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:1"/>And from there Abraam moved to the land toward the southwest and lived between Kades and between Sour and resided in Gerara as an alien.<verse eid="GEN 20:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:2"/>And Abraam said of his wife Sarra, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "She is my wife," lest perhaps the men of the city kill him on her account. Then Abimelech king of Gerara sent and took Sarra.<verse eid="GEN 20:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:3"/>And God came in to Abimelech in his<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">20:3</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note> sleep during the night and said, "Look, you are about to die by reason of the woman whom you have taken, whereas she is married to a man."<verse eid="GEN 20:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:4"/>Now Abimelech had not touched her, and he said, "Lord, will you destroy an unwitting and righteous nation?<verse eid="GEN 20:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:5"/>Did not he himself say to me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said to me, 'He is my brother.' I did this with a pure heart and righteousness of hands."<verse eid="GEN 20:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:6"/>Then God said to him during his<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">20:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note> sleep, "I too knew that you did this with a pure heart, and I was the one who spared you so that you did not sin in regard to me. Therefore I did not allow you to touch her.<verse eid="GEN 20:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:7"/>And now return the woman to the man, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you, and you will live. If, however, you do not restore her, know that you shall die, you and all that are yours."<verse eid="GEN 20:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:8"/>And Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and spoke of all these matters in their hearing; then all the men were very much afraid.<verse eid="GEN 20:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:9"/>And Abimelech called Abraam and said to him, "What is this you have done to us? Surely we have not committed some sin in regard to you, that you have brought great sin on me and on my kingdom? You have done a deed to me that no one shall do."<verse eid="GEN 20:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:10"/>And Abimelech said to Abraam, "What did you observe that you did this?"<verse eid="GEN 20:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:11"/>And Abraam said, "Because I said, It appears there is no piety in this place, and so they will kill me because of my wife.<verse eid="GEN 20:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:12"/>For indeed, she is truly my sister by my father, but not by my mother, and she became a wife to me.<verse eid="GEN 20:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:13"/>Now it came about when God brought me forth from my father's house, that then I said to her, 'This righteousness you shall do for me: in every place, there where we enter, say about me, He is my brother.' "<verse eid="GEN 20:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:14"/>Then Abimelech took a thousand didrachmas, sheep and calves and male and female slaves and gave them to Abraam and restored his wife Sarra to him.<verse eid="GEN 20:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:15"/>And Abimelech said to Abraam, "Look, my land is before you; settle where it may please you."<verse eid="GEN 20:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:16"/>And to Sarra he said, "Look, I have given your brother a thousand didrachmas; these shall be to you for the honor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">20:16</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'price'</char></note> of your person and to all those<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">20:16</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="GEN 20:17"/>Then Abraam prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his female slaves, and they gave birth.<verse eid="GEN 20:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 20:18"/>For the Lord had, in shutting off, shut off from the outside every womb in the house of Abimelech because of Sarra, Abraam's wife.<verse eid="GEN 20:18"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:1"/>And the Lord visited Sarra as he had said, and the Lord did for Sarra as he had spoken,<verse eid="GEN 21:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:2"/>and when Sarra had conceived, she bore Abraam a son in his old age at the appointed time, as the Lord had spoken to him.<verse eid="GEN 21:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:3"/>And Abraam called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarra bore him, Isaak.<verse eid="GEN 21:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:4"/>And Abraam circumcised Isaak on the eighth day, as God had commanded him.<verse eid="GEN 21:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:5"/>Now Abraam was a hundred years of age when his son Isaak was born to him.<verse eid="GEN 21:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:6"/>And Sarra said, "The Lord has made laughter for me, for anyone who hears will congratulate me."<verse eid="GEN 21:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:7"/>And she said, "Who will report to Abraam that Sarra is nursing a child? For I have borne a son in my old age."<verse eid="GEN 21:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:8"/>And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraam made a great banquet on the day his son Isaak was weaned.<verse eid="GEN 21:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:9"/>But when Sarra saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, who had been born to Abraam, playing with her son Isaak,<verse eid="GEN 21:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:10"/>then she said to Abraam, "Cast out this slave-girl and her son; for the son of this slave-girl shall not inherit together with my son Isaak."<verse eid="GEN 21:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:11"/>Now the matter seemed very hard in the sight of Abraam on account of his son.<verse eid="GEN 21:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:12"/>But God said to Abraam, "Do not let the matter be hard in your sight on account of the child and on account of the slave-girl; whatever Sarra says to you, obey her voice, for in Isaak offspring shall be named for you.<verse eid="GEN 21:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:13"/>And as for the son of the slave-girl, I will make him also into a great nation, because he is your offspring."<verse eid="GEN 21:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:14"/>Then Abraam rose in the morning and took bread loaves and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar and put them on her shoulder, along with the child and sent her away. And when she departed she began wandering about the wilderness over against the well of the oath.<verse eid="GEN 21:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:15"/>Then the water from the skin gave out, and she cast the child under a silver fir.<verse eid="GEN 21:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:16"/>And after departing she sat down opposite him a good way off, about a bowshot, for she said, "I will not look upon the death of my child." And she was seated opposite him, and the child cried out and wept.<verse eid="GEN 21:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:17"/>And God listened to the voice of the child from the place where he was, and God's angel called Hagar from heaven and said to her, "What is it, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has given ear to the voice of your child from the place where he is.<verse eid="GEN 21:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:18"/>Rise, take the child, and hold it fast with your hand, for I will make him into a great nation."<verse eid="GEN 21:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:19"/>And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of living water. And she went and filled the skin with water and gave the child a drink.<verse eid="GEN 21:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:20"/>And God was with the child, and he grew up. And he dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer.<verse eid="GEN 21:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:21"/>And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 21:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:22"/>And it came about at that time that then Abimelech, with Ochozath his groomsman and Phichol the commander-in-chief of his army, spoke to Abraam, saying, "God is with you in everything that you do;<verse eid="GEN 21:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:23"/>now then swear to me by God that you will not injure me nor my offspring nor my name, but according to the righteousness with which I have dealt with you, you will deal with me and the land that you have resided in as an alien."<verse eid="GEN 21:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:24"/>And Abraam said, "I will swear."<verse eid="GEN 21:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:25"/>And Abraam rebuked Abimelech on account of the wells of water that Abimelech's servants had taken away.<verse eid="GEN 21:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:26"/>And Abimelech said to him, "I did not know who did this deed, neither did you tell me, nor did I hear, except today."<verse eid="GEN 21:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:27"/>And Abraam took sheep and calves and gave them to Abimelech, and both made a covenant.<verse eid="GEN 21:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:28"/>And Abraam made seven ewe lambs of the sheep stand alone.<verse eid="GEN 21:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:29"/>And Abimelech said to Abraam, "Why are there the seven ewe lambs of these sheep that you have made stand alone?"<verse eid="GEN 21:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:30"/>And Abraam said, "Because<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">21:30</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Omit = Wevers Ed.</char></note> these seven ewe lambs you shall receive from me in order that they may become a witness for me that I am the one who dug this well."<verse eid="GEN 21:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:31"/>Therefore he named the name of that place Well-of-adjuration, because there both swore an oath.<verse eid="GEN 21:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:32"/>And they made a covenant at the well of the adjuration. Then Abimelech, with Ochozath his groomsman and Phichol the commander-in-chief of his army, rose and returned to the land of the Phylistieim.<verse eid="GEN 21:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:33"/>And Abraam planted a ploughed field<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">21:33</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'a ploughed field':  Or 'an aroura' = a measure of land (nearly two-thirds of an acre) in Egypt</char></note> by the well of the oath and there invoked the name of the Lord: Everlasting-god.<verse eid="GEN 21:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 21:34"/>And Abraam resided as an alien many days in the land of the Phylistieim.<verse eid="GEN 21:34"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:1"/>And it came about after these matters that God tested Abraam and said to him, "Abraam, Abraam!" And he said, "Here I am."<verse eid="GEN 22:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:2"/>And he said, "Take your beloved son Isaak, whom you love, and go into the high land, and offer him as a whole burnt offering on one of the mountains, whichever I mention to you."<verse eid="GEN 22:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:3"/>And when Abraam had risen in the morning, he saddled his donkey. Now he took along with himself two servants and his son Isaak, and after he had split wood for a whole burnt offering and risen, he went and came to the place that God had mentioned to him, (4) on the third day.<verse eid="GEN 22:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:4"/>And when Abraam looked up with his eyes, he saw the place far away.<verse eid="GEN 22:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:5"/>Then Abraam said to his servants, "Sit right here with the donkey, and the youngster and I will go through hither, and after we have done obeisance, we will come back to you."<verse eid="GEN 22:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:6"/>And Abraam took the wood of the whole burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaak; then he took both the fire and the knife in hand, and the two walked on together.<verse eid="GEN 22:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:7"/>And Isaak spoke to his father Abraam (when he had said, "Father!" and he had said, "What is it, child?") , saying, "Look, the fire and the wood! Where is the sheep for a whole burnt offering?"<verse eid="GEN 22:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:8"/>And Abraam said, "God will see to a sheep as a whole burnt offering for himself, child." And as both walked on together<verse eid="GEN 22:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:9"/>they came to the place that God had mentioned to him. And Abraam built the altar there and laid on the wood, and when he had bound his son Isaak hand and foot, he laid him on the altar atop the wood.<verse eid="GEN 22:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:10"/>Then Abraam reached out his hand to take the knife to slay his son.<verse eid="GEN 22:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:11"/>And the Lord's angel called him from heaven and said to him, "Abraam, Abraam!" And he said, "Here I am."<verse eid="GEN 22:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:12"/>And he said, "Do not lay your hand on the youngster nor do anything to him. For now I know that you do fear God, and for my sake you have not spared your beloved son."<verse eid="GEN 22:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:13"/>And as Abraam looked up with his eyes he saw, and see, a ram held fast in a sabek plant by the horns. And Abraam went and took the ram and offered it up as a whole burnt offering instead of his son Isaak.<verse eid="GEN 22:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:14"/>And Abraam called the name of that place "The-Lord-saw," that they might say today, "On the mountain the Lord appeared."<verse eid="GEN 22:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:15"/>And the Lord's angel called Abraam a second time from heaven, (16) saying,<verse eid="GEN 22:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:16"/>"By myself I have sworn, says the Lord: Inasmuch as you have carried out this matter and for my sake have not spared your beloved son,<verse eid="GEN 22:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:17"/>I will indeed bless you with blessings, and I will make your offspring as numerously numerous as the stars of heaven and as the sand that is by the seashore, and your offspring shall possess the cities of their adversaries,<verse eid="GEN 22:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:18"/>and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice."<verse eid="GEN 22:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:19"/>Then Abraam returned to his servants, and when they had risen, they went together to the well of the oath. And Abraam lived at the well of the oath.<verse eid="GEN 22:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:20"/>Now it came about after these matters, that then it was told Abraam-- they were saying-- "See, Melcha, she too has borne sons to your brother Nachor:<verse eid="GEN 22:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:21"/>Ox the firstborn and Baux his brother and Kamouel the ancestor of the Syrians<verse eid="GEN 22:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:22"/>and Chasad and Hazau and Phaldas and Iedlaph and Bathouel."<verse eid="GEN 22:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:23"/>And Bathouel became the father of Rebekka. These were eight sons whom Melcha bore to Nachor, Abraam's brother.<verse eid="GEN 22:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 22:24"/>And as for his concubine, whose name was Reema, she too bore Gaam and Tabech and Tochos and Mocha.<verse eid="GEN 22:24"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:1"/>Now the life of Sarra amounted to one hundred twenty-seven years.<verse eid="GEN 23:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:2"/>And Sarra died in the city of Arbok that is in the lowland (this is Chebron) in the land of Chanaan. And Abraam went to mourn for Sarra and to grieve.<verse eid="GEN 23:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:3"/>And Abraam rose up from his dead and spoke to the sons of Chet, saying,<verse eid="GEN 23:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:4"/>"I am a resident alien and a sojourner among you; therefore give me possession of a burying place among you, and I shall bury my dead away from me."<verse eid="GEN 23:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:5"/>And the sons of Chet replied to Abraam, saying,<verse eid="GEN 23:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:6"/>"Not so, lord; but hear us. You are a king from a god among us. Bury your dead in our choice tombs, for not one of us shall withhold from you any tomb to bury your dead there."<verse eid="GEN 23:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:7"/>And when he had risen Abraam did obeisance to the sons of Chet, the people of the land,<verse eid="GEN 23:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:8"/>and Abraam spoke to them, saying, "If you have it in your heart that I bury my dead away from my presence, hear me, and speak on my behalf to Ephron the son of Saar,<verse eid="GEN 23:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:9"/>and let him give me the double cave that he has, which is in part of his field. For the money it is worth let him give it to me among you for possession of a tomb."<verse eid="GEN 23:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:10"/>Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Chet, and in reply Ephron the Chettite spoke to Abraam, as the sons of Chet and all who were going into the city were listening, saying,<verse eid="GEN 23:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:11"/>"Be attentive to me, lord, and hear me. I give you the field and the cave that is in it; before all my fellow citizens I have given it to you; bury your dead."<verse eid="GEN 23:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:12"/>And Abraam did obeisance before the people of the land,<verse eid="GEN 23:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:13"/>and he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, "Since you are in my presence, listen to me! Accept from me the money for the field, and I shall bury my dead there."<verse eid="GEN 23:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:14"/>Then Ephron answered Abraam, saying,<verse eid="GEN 23:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:15"/>"No, lord, for I have heard of four hundred didrachmas of silver<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">23:15</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'four hundred didrachmas of silver':  I.e.

    <verse sid="GEN 23:16"/>And Abraam listened to Ephron, and Abraam handed over to Ephron the money that he had talked about in the hearing of the sons of Chet, four hundred didrachmas of silver certified by merchants.<verse eid="GEN 23:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:17"/>And the field of Ephron, which was at the double cave, which<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">23:17</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the field'</char></note> is facing Mambre, the field and the cave that was in it, and every tree that was in the field, that is within its borders round about, were assigned<verse eid="GEN 23:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:18"/>to Abraam as a possession before the sons of Chet and all who were going into the city.<verse eid="GEN 23:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:19"/>After this Abraam buried Sarra his wife in the field's double cave, which is opposite Mambre (this is Chebron) in the land of Chanaan.<verse eid="GEN 23:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 23:20"/>And the field and the cave that was in it were confirmed by the sons of Chet to Abraam for possession of a burying place.<verse eid="GEN 23:20"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:1"/>And Abraam was elderly, advanced in days, and the Lord blessed Abraam in regard to all things.<verse eid="GEN 24:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:2"/>And Abraam said to his servant, the elder of his household, the ruler of all that was his, "Put your hand under my thigh,<verse eid="GEN 24:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:3"/>and I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, so that you do not get a wife for my son Isaak from the daughters of the Chananites, whom I live among,<verse eid="GEN 24:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:4"/>but you shall go to my country, where I was born, and to my tribe, and get a wife for my son Isaak from there."<verse eid="GEN 24:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:5"/>And the servant said to him, "Perhaps the woman is not willing to go with me, back to this land. Shall I bring your son back to the land which you came from?"<verse eid="GEN 24:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:6"/>But Abraam said to him, "Take heed to yourself; do not bring my son back there.<verse eid="GEN 24:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:7"/>The Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth, who took me from my father's house and from the land where I was born, who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, 'To you I will give this land, and to your off-spring,' he will send his angel ahead of you, and you shall take a wife for my son Isaak from there.<verse eid="GEN 24:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:8"/>If, however, the woman does not wish to go with you to this land, you will be clear of this oath; only do not bring my son back there."<verse eid="GEN 24:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:9"/>And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraam his lord and swore to him concerning this matter.<verse eid="GEN 24:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:10"/>Then the servant took ten camels from his lord's camels and some of all his lord's goods with himself, and when he had risen, he went to Mesopotamia to the city of Nachor.<verse eid="GEN 24:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:11"/>And he allowed the camels to rest outside the city beside the well of water toward evening, when the women who fetch water go out.<verse eid="GEN 24:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:12"/>And he said, "O Lord, God of my lord Abraam, prosper the way before me today, and do mercy with my lord Abraam.<verse eid="GEN 24:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:13"/>Here I stand by the spring of water, and the daughters of those who live in the city are coming out to draw water,<verse eid="GEN 24:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:14"/>and it shall be that the maiden to whom I should say, 'Incline your jar to me in order that I may drink,' and she should say to me 'Drink, and I will water your camels until they stop drinking,' this one you prepared for your servant Isaak, and by this I shall know that you did mercy toward my lord Abraam."<verse eid="GEN 24:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:15"/>And it came about before he had finished speaking in his mind, that then, look, Rebekka, who was born to Bathouel son of Melcha the wife of Nachor-- and he was Abraam's brother-- was coming out with her water jar on her shoulders.<verse eid="GEN 24:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:16"/>Now the maiden was very beautiful in appearance; she was a maiden-- no man had known her. So then going down to the spring she filled her jar and came up.<verse eid="GEN 24:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:17"/>Then the servant ran up to meet her and said, "Give me a little water to drink from your jar."<verse eid="GEN 24:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:18"/>And she said, "Drink, lord." And she hurried and lowered the jar upon her arm and gave him a drink (19) until he stopped drinking.<verse eid="GEN 24:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:19"/>And she said, "I will fetch water for your camels also until they all have drunk."<verse eid="GEN 24:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:20"/>And she hurried and emptied the jar into the watering trough and ran again to the well to draw and fetched water for all the camels.<verse eid="GEN 24:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:21"/>Now the man was observing her closely and was keeping silent to learn whether or not the Lord had prospered his journey.<verse eid="GEN 24:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:22"/>And it came about when all the camels had stopped drinking, that the man took gold earrings a drachma each in weight and two bracelets for her arms, their weight being ten gold pieces.<verse eid="GEN 24:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:23"/>And he questioned her and said, "Whose daughter are you? Tell me: Is there room at your father's place for us to lodge?"<verse eid="GEN 24:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:24"/>And she said to him, "I am a daughter of Bathouel the son of Melcha, whom she bore to Nachor."<verse eid="GEN 24:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:25"/>And she said to him, "We have both straw and fodder in abundance and a place to lodge."<verse eid="GEN 24:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:26"/>And the man, being content, did obeisance to the Lord (27) and said,<verse eid="GEN 24:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:27"/>"Blessed be the Lord, the God of my lord Abraam, who has not left behind righteousness and truth from my lord. Me the Lord has prospered on the way to the house of my lord's kinsman."<verse eid="GEN 24:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:28"/>And running off, the girl brought news to her mother's house about these matters.<verse eid="GEN 24:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:29"/>Now Rebekka had a brother whose name was Laban, and Laban ran out to the man at the spring.<verse eid="GEN 24:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:30"/>And it came about as soon as he saw the earrings and the bracelets on his sister's arms, and when he heard the words of his sister Rebekka as she was saying, "Thus the man has spoken to me," that then he went to the man as he stood by the camels at the spring<verse eid="GEN 24:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:31"/>and said to him, "Here, come in. Blessed be the Lord. Why do you stand outside? As for me, I have prepared the dwelling and a place for the camels."<verse eid="GEN 24:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:32"/>Then the man came into the dwelling and unloaded the camels. And he gave him straw and fodder for the camels and water for his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.<verse eid="GEN 24:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:33"/>And he set bread loaves before them to eat. And he said, "I will not eat until I have spoken my piece." And they said, "Speak on."<verse eid="GEN 24:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:34"/>And he said, "I am Abraam's servant.<verse eid="GEN 24:34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:35"/>Now the Lord has greatly blessed my lord, and he has been exalted, and he has given him sheep and calves and silver and gold and male and female slaves, camels and donkeys.<verse eid="GEN 24:35"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:36"/>And Sarra my lord's wife bore one son to my lord after he had grown old, and he gave him as much as he had.<verse eid="GEN 24:36"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:37"/>And my lord administered an oath to me, saying, 'You shall not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Chananites, whom I am living among in their land,<verse eid="GEN 24:37"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:38"/>but you shall go to my father's house and to my tribe and get a wife for my son from there.'<verse eid="GEN 24:38"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:39"/>Then I said to my lord, 'Perhaps the woman will not go with me.'<verse eid="GEN 24:39"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:40"/>And he said to me, 'The Lord, whom I have been well pleasing before, he will send his angel with you and prosper your journey, and you shall get a wife for my son from my tribe and from my father's house.<verse eid="GEN 24:40"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:41"/>Then you will be free from my curse; indeed, when perchance you come to my tribe and they do not give her to you, then you will be free from my adjuration.'<verse eid="GEN 24:41"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:42"/>"And on coming today to the spring I said, 'O Lord, the God of my lord Abraam, if only you prosper my journey that I am now going on!<verse eid="GEN 24:42"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:43"/>Here I stand near the spring of water, and the daughters of the people of the city will come out to fetch water, and it shall be that the maiden to whom I should say, "Give me a little water from your jar to drink,"<verse eid="GEN 24:43"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:44"/>and she should say to me, "You drink, and I will fetch water for your camels too," may this be the woman whom the Lord prepared for his own attendant Isaak, and by this I shall know that you have done mercy toward my lord Abraam.'<verse eid="GEN 24:44"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:45"/>"And it came about before I finished speaking in my mind, that at once Rebekka was coming out with the water jar on her shoulders, and she went down to the spring and fetched water. Then I said to her, 'Give me a drink.'<verse eid="GEN 24:45"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:46"/>And hurriedly she let down the jar from herself and said, 'You drink, and I will water your camels.' And I drank, and she watered my camels.<verse eid="GEN 24:46"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:47"/>And I asked her and said, 'Whose daughter are you?' 'I am a daughter of Bathouel, Nachor's son,' said she, 'whom Melcha bore to him.' And I put the earrings on her and the bracelets around her arms.<verse eid="GEN 24:47"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:48"/>Then, being content, I did obeisance to the Lord and blessed the Lord, the God of my lord Abraam, who had prospered me on the way of truth to obtain the daughter of my lord's kinsman for his son.<verse eid="GEN 24:48"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:49"/>So if you are going to do mercy and righteousness toward my lord, tell me; but if not, tell me in order that I may turn to the right hand or to the left."<verse eid="GEN 24:49"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:50"/>Then Laban and Bathouel said in reply, "This ordinance has come from the Lord; therefore we shall not be able to speak against you bad for good.<verse eid="GEN 24:50"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:51"/>Look, Rebekka is before you; take her, leave quickly, and let her be wife to your lord's son, as the Lord has spoken."<verse eid="GEN 24:51"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:52"/>Now it came about when the servant of Abraam heard their words that he did obeisance upon the ground to the Lord.<verse eid="GEN 24:52"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:53"/>And when the servant had brought out articles of silver and gold and clothing, he gave them to Rebekka, and he gave gifts to her brother and mother.<verse eid="GEN 24:53"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:54"/>And he and the men who were with him ate and drank, and they went to bed. And when he rose in the morning, he said, "Send me away in order that I may depart to my lord."<verse eid="GEN 24:54"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:55"/>And her brothers and mother said, "Let the maiden remain with us about ten days, and after that she shall depart."<verse eid="GEN 24:55"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:56"/>But he said to them, "Do not detain me, and the Lord has prospered my journey; send me away in order that I may depart to my lord."<verse eid="GEN 24:56"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:57"/>Then they said, "Let us call the girl and ask her mouth."<verse eid="GEN 24:57"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:58"/>And they called Rebekka and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" And she said, "I will go."<verse eid="GEN 24:58"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:59"/>And they sent away their sister Rebekka and her possessions and Abraam's servant and those with him.<verse eid="GEN 24:59"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:60"/>And they blessed their sister Rebekka and said to her, "You are our sister; become thousands of myriads, and let your offspring gain possession of the cities of their adversaries."<verse eid="GEN 24:60"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:61"/>Then Rebekka and her maids, when they had risen, mounted the camels and went with the man, and taking along Rebekka, the servant departed.<verse eid="GEN 24:61"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:62"/>Now Isaak used to go through the wilderness over against the well of the appearance, but he was dwelling in the land that is toward the southwest.<verse eid="GEN 24:62"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:63"/>And Isaak went out toward evening to meditate in the plain, and looking up with his eyes he saw camels coming.<verse eid="GEN 24:63"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:64"/>And Rebekka, looking up with her eyes, saw Isaak and leaped down from the camel<verse eid="GEN 24:64"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:65"/>and said to the servant, "Who is that man who is walking on the plain to meet us?" And the servant said, "This is my lord." Then taking her light summer garment she threw it around herself.<verse eid="GEN 24:65"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:66"/>And the servant recounted to Isaak all the matters that he had carried out.<verse eid="GEN 24:66"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 24:67"/>Then Isaak entered into his mother's house and took Rebekka, and she became his wife, and he loved her. And Isaak was comforted concerning his mother Sarra.<verse eid="GEN 24:67"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:1"/>Now Abraam again took a wife, whose name was Chettoura.<verse eid="GEN 25:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:2"/>And she bore him Zembran and Iexan and Madan and Madiam and Iesbok and Soye.<verse eid="GEN 25:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:3"/>And Iexan was the father of Saba and Thaiman and Daidan. And the sons of Daidan were Ragouel and Nabdeel and Assourieim and Latousieim and Loomieim.<verse eid="GEN 25:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:4"/>And the sons of Madiam: Gaiphar and Apher and Henoch<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">25:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Enoch'</char></note> and Abira and Elraga. These all were the sons of Chettoura.<verse eid="GEN 25:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:5"/>And Abraam gave all his possessions to his son Isaak,<verse eid="GEN 25:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:6"/>and to the sons of his concubines Abraam gave gifts, and while he was still living he sent them away from his son Isaak, eastward to the east country.<verse eid="GEN 25:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:7"/>Now these are the years of the days of the life of Abraam that he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.<verse eid="GEN 25:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:8"/>And breathing his last, Abraam died at a good old age, an old man and full of days, and was added to his people.<verse eid="GEN 25:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:9"/>And his sons Isaak and Ismael buried him in the double cave in the field of Ephron the son of Saar the Chettite, which is opposite Mambre,<verse eid="GEN 25:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:10"/>the field and the cave that Abraam acquired from the sons of Chet; there they buried Abraam and his wife Sarra.<verse eid="GEN 25:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:11"/>And it came about after Abraam died that God blessed his son Isaak. And Isaak settled by the well of the appearance.<verse eid="GEN 25:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:12"/>Now these are the generations of Ismael, Abraam's son, whom Hagar, Sarra's slave-girl, bore to Abraam,<verse eid="GEN 25:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:13"/>and these are the names of the sons of Ismael, by the name of his clans: Nabaioth, the firstborn of Ismael, and Kedar and Nabdeel and Massam<verse eid="GEN 25:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:14"/>and Masma and Idouma and Masse<verse eid="GEN 25:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:15"/>and Choddad and Thaiman and Ietour and Naphes and Kedma.<verse eid="GEN 25:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:16"/>These are the sons of Ismael, and these are their names in their tents and in their encampments, twelve rulers according to their nations.<verse eid="GEN 25:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:17"/>And these are the years of the life of Ismael: one hundred thirty-seven years, and breathing his last he died and was added to his kin.<verse eid="GEN 25:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:18"/>Now he settled from Heuilat to Sour, which is facing Egypt, until one comes to the Assyrians; he settled facing all his kinfolk.<verse eid="GEN 25:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:19"/>And these are the generations of Isaak, Abraam's son: Abraam was the father of Isaak.<verse eid="GEN 25:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:20"/>Now Isaak was forty years of age when he took Rebekka, daughter of Bathouel the Syrian of Mesopotamia, sister of Laban the Syrian, as a wife for himself.<verse eid="GEN 25:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:21"/>And Isaak petitioned the Lord concerning his wife Rebekka, because she was barren, and God heard him, and his wife Rebekka became pregnant.<verse eid="GEN 25:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:22"/>And the children were cavorting within her, and she said, "If it is thus going to be with me, why do I have this?" Then she went to inquire of the Lord,<verse eid="GEN 25:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:23"/>and the Lord said to her, "Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from your uterus shall be divided, and a people shall excel over a people, and the greater shall be subject to the lesser."<verse eid="GEN 25:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:24"/>And the days for her to give birth were completed, and she had twins in her uterus.<verse eid="GEN 25:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:25"/>And the firstborn son came out red all over like a hairy hide; then she named his name Esau.<verse eid="GEN 25:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:26"/>And afterward his brother came out, with his hand gripping Esau's heel, and she called his name Iakob. Now Isaak was sixty years of age when Rebekka bore them.<verse eid="GEN 25:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:27"/>So the boys grew up, and Esau was a man who knew how to hunt, a rustic, while Iakob was a simple man, living at home.<verse eid="GEN 25:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:28"/>And Isaak loved Esau, because his game was food for him; Rebekka, however, loved Iakob.<verse eid="GEN 25:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:29"/>Now Iakob cooked a stew, and Esau came from the plain languishing,<verse eid="GEN 25:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:30"/>and Esau said to Iakob, "Give me a taste of this red stew, for I am languishing!" Therefore his name was called Edom.<verse eid="GEN 25:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:31"/>And Iakob said to Esau, "Sell to me today your rights of primogeniture."<verse eid="GEN 25:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:32"/>And Esau said, "Look, I am going to perish, and why do I have these rights of primogeniture?"<verse eid="GEN 25:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:33"/>And Iakob said to him, "Swear to me today." And he swore to him, and Esau sold the rights of primogeniture to Iakob.<verse eid="GEN 25:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 25:34"/>And Iakob gave Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and getting up he went away. And Esau trivialized the rights of primogeniture.<verse eid="GEN 25:34"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:1"/>Now a famine occurred upon the land, besides the former famine that had occurred in the time of Abraam. Then Isaak went to Gerara, to Abimelech, king of Phylistieim.<verse eid="GEN 26:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:2"/>And the Lord appeared to him and said, "Do not go down to Egypt, but settle in the land about which I speak to you.<verse eid="GEN 26:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:3"/>And reside in this land as an alien, and I will be with you and will bless you. For to you and to your offspring I will give all this land, and I will establish my oath that I swore to your father Abraam.<verse eid="GEN 26:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:4"/>And I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of heaven and will give to your offspring all this land, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in your offspring,<verse eid="GEN 26:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:5"/>since your father Abraam obeyed my voice and kept my ordinances and my commandments and my statutes and my precepts."<verse eid="GEN 26:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:6"/>And Isaak settled in Gerara.<verse eid="GEN 26:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:7"/>Then the men of the place asked about his wife Rebekka, and he said, "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "She is my wife," lest perhaps the men of the place kill him for the sake of Rebekka, because she was attractive in appearance.<verse eid="GEN 26:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:8"/>And he stayed on there quite some time. Now Abimelech the king of Gerara, when he peered through the window, saw Isaak playing around with his wife Rebekka.<verse eid="GEN 26:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:9"/>Then Abimelech summoned Isaak and said to him, "So then she is your wife! Why is it that you said, 'She is my sister'?" And Isaak said to him, "Because I said, 'Lest perhaps I die because of her.' "<verse eid="GEN 26:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:10"/>And Abimelech said to him, "What is this you have done to us? Very nearly did someone of my kin lie with your wife, and you had brought ignorance upon us."<verse eid="GEN 26:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:11"/>Then Abimelech instructed all his people, saying, "Anyone who touches this man or his wife shall be liable to the death penalty."<verse eid="GEN 26:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:12"/>And Isaak sowed seed in that land and in that year found barley bearing a hundredfold. And the Lord blessed him,<verse eid="GEN 26:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:13"/>and the man was exalted, and he kept getting greater until he became very great.<verse eid="GEN 26:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:14"/>And he had flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and many tilled fields. And the Phylistieim envied him,<verse eid="GEN 26:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:15"/>and all the wells that his father's servants had dug in the time of his father-- the Phylistieim stopped them up and filled them with earth.<verse eid="GEN 26:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:16"/>And Abimelech said to Isaak, "Go away from us, for you have become much more powerful than we."<verse eid="GEN 26:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:17"/>And Isaak departed from there and lodged in the ravine of Gerara and settled there.<verse eid="GEN 26:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:18"/>And again Isaak dug the wells of water that the servants of his father Abraam had dug, and the Phylistieim had stopped them up after his father Abraam had died, and he gave them names in accordance with the names that his father had named.<verse eid="GEN 26:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:19"/>And Isaak's servants dug in the ravine of Gerara and found there a well of living water.<verse eid="GEN 26:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:20"/>And the herders of Gerara quarreled with Isaak's herders, asserting that the water was theirs. And he called the name of the well Injustice, for they did him injustice.<verse eid="GEN 26:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:21"/>Then setting out from there he dug another well, but they were disputing over that one also, and he named its name Enmity.<verse eid="GEN 26:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:22"/>Then setting out from there he dug another well, and they did not quarrel over it, and he named its name Open-space, saying, "Inasmuch as now the Lord has made room for us and increased us on the land."<verse eid="GEN 26:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:23"/>And from there he went up to the well of the oath.<verse eid="GEN 26:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:24"/>And on that night the Lord appeared to him and said, "I am the God of your father Abraam; do not be afraid, for I am with you and have blessed you and will make your offspring numerous for your father Abraam's sake."<verse eid="GEN 26:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:25"/>And he built an altar there and invoked the name of the Lord and pitched his tent there. And there Isaak's servants dug a well.<verse eid="GEN 26:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:26"/>And Abimelech went to him from Gerara with Ochozath his groomsman and Phichol the commander-in-chief of his army.<verse eid="GEN 26:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:27"/>And Isaak said to them, "Why did you come to me? You are the ones who hated me and sent me away from you."<verse eid="GEN 26:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:28"/>And they said, "Seeing, we have seen that the Lord was with you, and we said, Let there come to be an oath between you and between us, and we will make a covenant with you<verse eid="GEN 26:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:29"/>that you will not do us harm, just as we did not loathe you, and as we treated you well and sent you away in peace. And now you are blessed by the Lord."<verse eid="GEN 26:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:30"/>And he made them a banquet, and they ate and drank.<verse eid="GEN 26:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:31"/>And when they had risen in the morning, they swore an oath, one person to the next, and Isaak sent them off, and they departed from him in safety.<verse eid="GEN 26:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:32"/>And it came about on that day that then Isaak's servants, when they arrived, told him about the well that they had dug and said, "We did not find water."<verse eid="GEN 26:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:33"/>And he called it Oath; therefore he called the city's name Well-of-oath, to the present day.<verse eid="GEN 26:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:34"/>Now Esau was forty years of age, and he took as a wife Ioudin the daughter of Beer the Chettite and Basemmath daughter of Ailon the Heuite.<verse eid="GEN 26:34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 26:35"/>And they were contending with Isaak and with Rebekka.<verse eid="GEN 26:35"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:1"/>Now it came about after Isaak had grown old and his eyes had become too dim to see, that then he called his elder son Esau and said to him, "My son," and he said, "Here I am."<verse eid="GEN 27:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:2"/>And he said, "See, I have grown old, and I do not know the day of my death.<verse eid="GEN 27:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:3"/>Now therefore take your equipment, both quiver and bow, and go out into the plain, and hunt game for me,<verse eid="GEN 27:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:4"/>and prepare for me victuals, such as I like, and bring them to me in order that I may eat, so that my soul may bless you before I die."<verse eid="GEN 27:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:5"/>Now Rebekka heard Isaak speaking to his son Esau. And Esau went into the plain to hunt game for his father.<verse eid="GEN 27:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:6"/>Then Rebekka said to her lesser son Iakob, "Look, I heard your father speaking to your brother Esau, saying,<verse eid="GEN 27:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:7"/>'Bring me game, and prepare for me victuals in order that when I have eaten I may bless you in the presence of the Lord before I die.'<verse eid="GEN 27:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:8"/>Now then, son, listen to me, as I command you,<verse eid="GEN 27:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:9"/>and go to the flocks; get me two kids from there, tender and good, and I shall prepare them as victuals for your father, such as he likes,<verse eid="GEN 27:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:10"/>and you shall bring them in to your father, and he will eat, so that your father may bless you before he dies."<verse eid="GEN 27:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:11"/>But Iakob said to his mother Rebekka, "My brother Esau is a hairy man, while I am a smooth man.<verse eid="GEN 27:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:12"/>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall be before him like a scorner and bring a curse on myself and not a blessing."<verse eid="GEN 27:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:13"/>But his mother said to him, "Your curse be on me, child; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me."<verse eid="GEN 27:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:14"/>And he went, got them and brought them to his mother, and his mother prepared victuals, just as his father used to love them.<verse eid="GEN 27:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:15"/>And Rebekka, when she had taken the fine garment of her elder son Esau, which was with her in the house, then she put it on her younger son Iakob,<verse eid="GEN 27:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:16"/>and she placed the skins of the kids on his arms and on the bare parts of his neck,<verse eid="GEN 27:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:17"/>and she gave the victuals and the bread loaves that she had prepared into the hands of her son Iakob.<verse eid="GEN 27:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:18"/>And he brought them in to his father. And he said, "Father." And he said, "Here I am; who are you, child?"<verse eid="GEN 27:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:19"/>And Iakob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn; I have done according to what you talked about to me; rise, sit, and eat of my game, so that your soul may bless me."<verse eid="GEN 27:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:20"/>But Isaak said to his son, "What is this that you have quickly found, O child?" And he said, "That which the Lord your God delivered up before me."<verse eid="GEN 27:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:21"/>Then Isaak said to Iakob, "Come near to me, and I shall feel you, child, whether you are my son Esau or not."<verse eid="GEN 27:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:22"/>And Iakob drew near to his father Isaak, and he felt him and said, "The voice is Iakob's voice, yet the hands are the hands of Esau."<verse eid="GEN 27:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:23"/>And he did not recognize him, for his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands, and he blessed him.<verse eid="GEN 27:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:24"/>And he said, "Are you my son Esau?" And he said, "I am."<verse eid="GEN 27:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:25"/>And he said, "Bring it to me, and I shall eat of your game, child, in order that my soul may bless you." And he presented it to him, and he ate, and he brought wine in to him, and he drank.<verse eid="GEN 27:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:26"/>And his father Isaak said to him, "Come near to me, and kiss me, child."<verse eid="GEN 27:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:27"/>And coming near he kissed him, and he smelled the scent of his clothes and blessed him and said, "See, my son's scent is like the scent of a full field that the Lord has blessed.<verse eid="GEN 27:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:28"/>And may God give you of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and an abundance of grain and wine.<verse eid="GEN 27:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:29"/>And let nations be subject to you, and rulers shall do obeisance to you, and become lord over your brother, and your father's sons shall do obeisance to you. Accursed is the one who curses you, but blessed is the one who blesses you!"<verse eid="GEN 27:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:30"/>And it came about after Isaak had left off blessing his son Iakob, and it came about when Iakob had gone out from the presence of his father Isaak, that then his brother Esau came from the hunt.<verse eid="GEN 27:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:31"/>And he too prepared victuals and presented them to his father and said to his father, "Let my father rise and eat of his son's game, so that your soul may bless me."<verse eid="GEN 27:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:32"/>And his father Isaak said to him, "Who are you?" And he said, "I am your firstborn son, Esau."<verse eid="GEN 27:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:33"/>Then Isaak was astonished with very great astonishment and said, "So who was the one who hunted game for me and brought it in to me? And I ate of everything before you came, and I blessed him, and let him be blessed!"<verse eid="GEN 27:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:34"/>Now it came about when Esau heard his father Isaak's words, that then he uttered a very great and bitter<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">27:34</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'very great and bitter':  Or 'great and very bitter'</char></note> cry and said, "Do bless me also, father!"<verse eid="GEN 27:34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:35"/>But he said to him, "Your brother, coming with deceit, took away your blessing."<verse eid="GEN 27:35"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:36"/>And he said, "His name was rightly called Iakob, for he has supplanted me now this second time. He has both taken away my rights of primogeniture, and now he has taken away my blessing." Then Esau said to his father, "Did you not leave a blessing for me, father?"<verse eid="GEN 27:36"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:37"/>And in reply Isaak said to Esau, "If I made him your lord, and I made all his brothers his domestics, with grain and wine I sustained him, then what shall I do for you, child?"<verse eid="GEN 27:37"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:38"/>And Esau said to his father, "Surely you do not have only<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">27:38</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note> one blessing, father? Do bless me also, father!" And with Isaak cut to the quick, Esau uttered a cry and wept.<verse eid="GEN 27:38"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:39"/>Then in reply his father Isaak said to him: "See, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven on high.<verse eid="GEN 27:39"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:40"/>And by your dagger you shall live, and you shall be subject to your brother, but it shall be that when perchance you bring him down, then you shall loose his yoke from your neck."<verse eid="GEN 27:40"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:41"/>And Esau was indignant at Iakob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him. Then Esau said in his mind, "Let the days of mourning for my father come near in order that I may kill my brother Iakob."<verse eid="GEN 27:41"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:42"/>But the words of her elder son Esau were told to Rebekka, and she sent and called her younger son Iakob and said to him, "See, your brother Esau is threatening you to kill you.<verse eid="GEN 27:42"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:43"/>Now then, child, listen to my voice, and rise, escape to Mesopotamia to my brother Laban in Charran,<verse eid="GEN 27:43"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:44"/>and dwell with him some days<verse eid="GEN 27:44"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:45"/>until your brother's wrath and anger turn away from you, and he forgets what you have done to him, and I will send for and summon you from there-- lest perhaps I be bereaved of you two children in one day."<verse eid="GEN 27:45"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 27:46"/>Then Rebekka said to Isaak, "I have become irritated with my life because of the daughters of the sons of Chet. If Iakob will take a wife from the daughters of this land, why shall I live?"<verse eid="GEN 27:46"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:1"/>Then Isaak, having called for Iakob, blessed him and commanded him, saying, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Chanaan.<verse eid="GEN 28:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:2"/>Rise, escape to Mesopotamia to the house of Bathouel, your mother's father, and take a wife for yourself from there from the daughters of Laban, your mother's brother.<verse eid="GEN 28:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:3"/>And may my God bless you and make you increase and make you numerous, and you shall become gatherings of nations.<verse eid="GEN 28:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:4"/>And may he give to you the blessing of my father Abraam, to you and to your offspring after you, to possess the land of your living as an alien, which God gave to Abraam."<verse eid="GEN 28:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:5"/>And Isaak sent Iakob away, and he went to Mesopotamia, to Laban the son of Bathouel the Syrian and brother of Rebekka the mother of Iakob and Esau.<verse eid="GEN 28:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:6"/>Now Esau saw that Isaak blessed Iakob and that he was on his way to Mesopotamia of Syria to take a wife from there for himself, that as he was blessing him he also commanded him, saying, "You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Chanaan,"<verse eid="GEN 28:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:7"/>and that Iakob obeyed his father and mother and went to Mesopotamia,<verse eid="GEN 28:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:8"/>and Esau saw that the daughters of Chanaan were evil in the sight of his father Isaak,<verse eid="GEN 28:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:9"/>and Esau went to Ismael and took Maeleth daughter of Abraam's son Ismael, sister of Nabaioth, as a wife in addition to his wives.<verse eid="GEN 28:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:10"/>And Iakob departed from the well of the oath and went to Charran.<verse eid="GEN 28:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:11"/>And he came upon a place and lay down there, for the sun had set. And he took one<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">28:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note> of the stones of the place and put it at his head and lay down in that place.<verse eid="GEN 28:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:12"/>And he dreamed, and see, a ladder set firmly in the earth, whose top was reaching into heaven, and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.<verse eid="GEN 28:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:13"/>And the Lord leaned on it and said, "I am the Lord, the God of Abraam your father and the God of Isaak; do not be afraid; as for the land which you are sleeping on, I will give it to you and to your offspring.<verse eid="GEN 28:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:14"/>And your offspring shall be like the sand of the earth, and it shall widen out to the sea and to the southwest and to the north and to the east, and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in you and in your offspring.<verse eid="GEN 28:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:15"/>And see, I am with you, carefully guarding you in every way where you might go, and I will bring you back to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done all the things that I talked about to you."<verse eid="GEN 28:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:16"/>And Iakob woke from his sleep and said, "The Lord is in this place-- yet I did not know it!"<verse eid="GEN 28:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:17"/>And he was afraid and said, "How awesome is this place! This is nothing other than a divine house, and this is the gate of heaven."<verse eid="GEN 28:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:18"/>And Iakob rose in the morning, and he took the stone that he had put down there at his head and set it up for a stele and poured oil on the top of it.<verse eid="GEN 28:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:19"/>And Iakob called the name of that place Divine-house, and the city's name was formerly Oulamlouz.<verse eid="GEN 28:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:20"/>And Iakob made a vow, saying, "If the Lord God should be with me and should carefully guard me in this way that I go and should give me bread to eat and clothing to put on<verse eid="GEN 28:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:21"/>and should bring me back to my father's house in safety, then the Lord shall become god to me,<verse eid="GEN 28:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 28:22"/>and this stone, which I have set up for a stele, shall be a divine house to me, and of all things that you might give me, as a tithe I will tithe them to you."<verse eid="GEN 28:22"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:1"/>And Iakob, lifting up his feet, went to the land of the east, to Laban the son of Bathouel the Syrian and brother of Rebekka, mother of Iakob and Esau.<verse eid="GEN 29:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:2"/>And he was looking, and there was a well in the plain, and three flocks of sheep were resting there near it, for out of that well they would water the flocks. Now a large stone was on the well's mouth,<verse eid="GEN 29:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:3"/>and all the flocks would be gathered there, and they<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">29:3</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'shepherds'</char></note> would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep and restore the stone to its place on the mouth of the well.<verse eid="GEN 29:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:4"/>And Iakob said to them, "Brothers, where are you from?" And they said, "We are from Charran."<verse eid="GEN 29:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:5"/>Then he said to them, "Do you know Laban the son of Nachor?" And they said, "We know him."<verse eid="GEN 29:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:6"/>And he said to them, "Is he well?" And they said, "He is well." And see, his daughter Rachel was coming with the sheep.<verse eid="GEN 29:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:7"/>And Iakob said, "There is still much daylight; it is not yet time for the livestock to be gathered together. Water the sheep; go off, and pasture them."<verse eid="GEN 29:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:8"/>But they said, "We shall not be able to until all the shepherds have been gathered together, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and we shall water the sheep."<verse eid="GEN 29:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:9"/>While he was still speaking with them, then Laban's daughter Rachel was coming with her father's sheep, for she was tending her father's sheep.<verse eid="GEN 29:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:10"/>Now it came about when Iakob saw Rachel, daughter of his mother's brother Laban, and the sheep of his mother's brother Laban, that then Iakob, drawing near, rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the sheep of his moth-er's brother Laban.<verse eid="GEN 29:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:11"/>And Iakob kissed Rachel, and crying out with his voice he wept.<verse eid="GEN 29:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:12"/>And he told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman and that he was Rebekka's son, and running off, she reported to her father concerning these matters.<verse eid="GEN 29:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:13"/>And it came about when Laban heard the name of his sister's son Iakob, that he ran to meet him and, embracing him, kissed him and brought him into his house. And he related to Laban all these particulars.<verse eid="GEN 29:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:14"/>And Laban said to him, "You are of my bones and of my flesh!" And he was with him a month of days.<verse eid="GEN 29:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:15"/>Then Laban said to Iakob, "Indeed, because you are my kinsman, you shall not be subject to me for nothing. Tell me what your wage is."<verse eid="GEN 29:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:16"/>Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the bigger was Leia, and the name of the younger was Rachel.<verse eid="GEN 29:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:17"/>And Leia's eyes were weak, but Rachel was shapely in figure and lovely in appearance.<verse eid="GEN 29:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:18"/>Now Iakob loved Rachel, and he said, "I will be subject to you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."<verse eid="GEN 29:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:19"/>And Laban said to him, "It is better that I give her to you than that I give her to another man; dwell with me."<verse eid="GEN 29:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:20"/>And Iakob was subject seven years for Rachel, and they were in his sight like a few days because he loved her.<verse eid="GEN 29:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:21"/>Then Iakob said to Laban, "Give up my wife, that I may go in to her, for my days have been completed."<verse eid="GEN 29:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:22"/>And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a wedding feast.<verse eid="GEN 29:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:23"/>And evening came, and Laban, taking his daughter Leia, brought her in to Iakob, and Iakob went in to her.<verse eid="GEN 29:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:24"/>Now Laban gave to his daughter Leia his maid Zelpha as a maid for her.<verse eid="GEN 29:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:25"/>Then morning came, and there was Leia! And Iakob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Was I not subject to you for Rachel? And why have you deceived me?"<verse eid="GEN 29:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:26"/>And Laban said, "It is not possible thus in our locality to give the younger before the elder.<verse eid="GEN 29:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:27"/>Therefore finish the heptad<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">29:27</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'seven-day feast'</char></note> of this one, and I will give you this one also in return for work that you shall do at my place for yet another seven years."<verse eid="GEN 29:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:28"/>And Iakob did so and fulfilled her heptad<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">29:28</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'seven-day feast'</char></note>, and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife for him.<verse eid="GEN 29:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:29"/>Now Laban gave his maid Balla to his daughter Rachel as a maid for her.<verse eid="GEN 29:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:30"/>And he went in to Rachel, and he loved Rachel more than Leia. And he was subject to him another seven years.<verse eid="GEN 29:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:31"/>Now when the Lord saw that Leia was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was barren.<verse eid="GEN 29:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:32"/>And Leia conceived and bore a son to Iakob, and she called his name Rouben, saying, "Inasmuch as the Lord has seen my humiliation, now it is me my husband will love."<verse eid="GEN 29:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:33"/>And Leia conceived again and bore a second son to Iakob and said, "Because the Lord has heard that I am hated, he has also in addition given me this one too," and she called his name Symeon.<verse eid="GEN 29:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:34"/>And yet again she conceived and bore a son and said, "At the present time my husband will be on my side, for I have borne him three sons"; therefore she called his name Leui.<verse eid="GEN 29:34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 29:35"/>And after she had conceived yet again, she bore a son and said, "Now yet again with respect to this I will acknowledge the Lord"; therefore she called his name Ioudas<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">29:35</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Iouda'</char></note>; then she ceased to bear.<verse eid="GEN 29:35"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:1"/>Now when Rachel saw that she had not given birth for Iakob, then Rachel envied her sister, and she said to Iakob, "Give me children; otherwise, I shall die!"<verse eid="GEN 30:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:2"/>And Iakob became angry with Rachel and said, "Surely I am not in the place of a god who has deprived you with respect to the fruit of the womb?"<verse eid="GEN 30:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:3"/>Then she said to Iakob, "Here is my female slave Balla; go in to her, and she shall bear upon my knees, and I too shall have children by her."<verse eid="GEN 30:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:4"/>And she gave him her female slave Balla as a wife for him, and Iakob went in to her.<verse eid="GEN 30:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:5"/>And Rachel's female slave Balla conceived and bore Iakob a son.<verse eid="GEN 30:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:6"/>And Rachel said, "God has judged me and heard my voice and given me a son"; therefore she called his name Dan.<verse eid="GEN 30:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:7"/>And Rachel's female slave Balla conceived yet again, and she bore Iakob a second son.<verse eid="GEN 30:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:8"/>And Rachel said, "God has assisted me, and I have lived together with my sister and have been strong enough," and she called his name Nephthali.<verse eid="GEN 30:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:9"/>Now Leia saw that she had ceased to bear, and she took her female slave Zelpha and gave her to Iakob as a wife.<verse eid="GEN 30:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:10"/>Then Iakob went in to her, and Leia's female slave Zelpha conceived and bore Iakob a son.<verse eid="GEN 30:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:11"/>And Leia said, "By fortune!" and she named his name Gad.<verse eid="GEN 30:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:12"/>And Leia's female slave Zelpha conceived and bore Iakob a second son as well.<verse eid="GEN 30:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:13"/>And Leia said, "Happy am I! For the women pronounce me happy," and she called his name Aser.<verse eid="GEN 30:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:14"/>Now in the days of wheat harvest Rouben went and found mandrake apples in the field and brought them to his mother Leia. Then Rachel said to Leia, "Give me some of your son's mandrakes."<verse eid="GEN 30:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:15"/>But Leia said, "Is it not enough for you that you have taken away my husband? Surely you will not also take away my son's mandrakes?" Then Rachel said, "Not so; let him lie with you through this night in exchange for your son's mandrakes."<verse eid="GEN 30:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:16"/>And Iakob came in from a field at evening, and Leia went out to meet him and said, "You shall come in to me today, for I have hired you in exchange for my son's mandrakes." And he lay with her through that night.<verse eid="GEN 30:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:17"/>And God heard Leia, and after she had conceived she bore Iakob a fifth son.<verse eid="GEN 30:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:18"/>And Leia said, "God has given me my hire, since I gave my female slave to my husband," and she called his name Issachar, which is Hire.<verse eid="GEN 30:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:19"/>And Leia conceived yet again, and she bore Iakob a sixth son.<verse eid="GEN 30:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:20"/>Then Leia said, "God has given a good gift to me; at the present time my husband will choose me, for I have borne him six sons," and she called his name Zaboulon.<verse eid="GEN 30:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:21"/>And afterwards she bore a daughter and called her name Dina.<verse eid="GEN 30:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:22"/>Then God remembered Rachel, and God heard her and opened her uterus,<verse eid="GEN 30:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:23"/>and after she had conceived she bore Iakob a son. And Rachel said, "God has taken away my reproach,"<verse eid="GEN 30:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:24"/>and she called his name Ioseph, saying, "Let God add to me another son!"<verse eid="GEN 30:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:25"/>Now it came about when Rachel had borne Ioseph, that Iakob said to Laban, "Send me away in order that I may depart to my region and to my country.<verse eid="GEN 30:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:26"/>Give up my wives and children, on account of whom I was subject to you, in order that I may depart, for you know very well the servitude with which I have served you."<verse eid="GEN 30:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:27"/>But Laban said to him, "If I had found favor before you, I would have learned it by ornithomancy. Indeed, God blessed me by your coming.<verse eid="GEN 30:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:28"/>Specify your wage to me, and I will give it."<verse eid="GEN 30:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:29"/>Then Iakob said to him, "You do know in what things I was subject to you and how numerous your cattle have been with me.<verse eid="GEN 30:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:30"/>For what you had before me was little, and it increased to a multitude, and the Lord blessed you at my foot. Now then when shall I too prepare a household for myself?"<verse eid="GEN 30:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:31"/>And Laban said to him, "What shall I give to you?" And Iakob said to him, "You shall not give me anything; if you carry out this matter for me, I will again shepherd your sheep, and I will keep them.<verse eid="GEN 30:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:32"/>Let your sheep pass by today, and separate thence every grey sheep among the lambs and every pure white and spotted one among the goats; such shall be my wage.<verse eid="GEN 30:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:33"/>And my righteousness will hearken to me tomorrow, because my wage is before you. Any one that is not spotted and pure white among the goats and grey among the lambs shall, in my judgment, have been stolen."<verse eid="GEN 30:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:34"/>Then Laban said to him, "Let it be according to your word."<verse eid="GEN 30:34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:35"/>And on that day he set apart the male goats that were spotted and pure white and all the female goats that were spotted and pure white and every one that was white among them and every one that was grey among the lambs and gave them into the control of his sons.<verse eid="GEN 30:35"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:36"/>And he put a distance of three days' journey between them and between Iakob. Now Iakob was shepherding Laban's remaining sheep.<verse eid="GEN 30:36"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:37"/>And Iakob took for himself a green rod of styrax and walnut and one of a plane tree, and Iakob stripped white stripes in them, tearing away the green. And the white that he had stripped appeared variegated on the rods.<verse eid="GEN 30:37"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:38"/>And he set the rods that he had stripped in the channels of the watering troughs of water in order that, when the sheep would come to drink in front of the rods, as they came for drinking, (39) the sheep would come into heat at the rods,<verse eid="GEN 30:38"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:39"/>and the sheep would produce pure white and variegated and ash-colored spotted young.<verse eid="GEN 30:39"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:40"/>And Iakob set apart the lambs and set before the sheep a pure white ram and every variegated one among the lambs, and he separated flocks for himself on his own and did not mix them with Laban's sheep.<verse eid="GEN 30:40"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:41"/>Now it came about in the season in which the sheep came into heat, as they were conceiving, that Iakob placed the rods in the channels before the sheep that they might come into heat opposite the rods,<verse eid="GEN 30:41"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:42"/>but when the sheep would give birth, he would not place them; so then the unmarked were Laban's, and the marked Iakob's.<verse eid="GEN 30:42"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 30:43"/>And the man became very, very rich and had large herds and cattle and male slaves and female slaves and camels and donkeys.<verse eid="GEN 30:43"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:1"/>Now Iakob heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying, "Iakob has taken all that was our father's, and he has made all this glory from what was our father's."<verse eid="GEN 31:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:2"/>And Iakob saw Laban's face, and see, it was not towards him as it was yesterday and the third day.<verse eid="GEN 31:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:3"/>Then the Lord said to Iakob, "Return to the land of your father and to your kindred, and I will be with you."<verse eid="GEN 31:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:4"/>And Iakob sent for and called Leia and Rachel into the plain where his flocks were<verse eid="GEN 31:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:5"/>and said to them, "I see your father's face, that it is not in favor of me as yesterday and the third day, but the God of my father has been with me.<verse eid="GEN 31:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:6"/>Now you yourselves too know that I was subject to your father with all my strength.<verse eid="GEN 31:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:7"/>Yet your father cheated me, and aexchanged my wage for<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">31:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'changed my wage of'</char></note> ten lambs, and God did not give him leave to harm me.<verse eid="GEN 31:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:8"/>If he should say thus, 'The variegated shall be your wage,' then all the sheep will bear variegated, but if he should say, 'The white shall be your wage,' then all the sheep will bear white.<verse eid="GEN 31:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:9"/>And God took away all the livestock of your father and gave them to me.<verse eid="GEN 31:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:10"/>"And it came about when the sheep were coming into heat, that then I saw them with my eyes in my sleep, and see, the male goats and the rams-- pure white and variegated and ash-colored spotted-- were mounting the sheep and the female goats.<verse eid="GEN 31:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:11"/>And the angel of God said to me during sleep, 'Iakob.' And I said, 'What is it?'<verse eid="GEN 31:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:12"/>And he said, 'Look up with your eyes, and see the male goats and the rams-- pure white and variegated and ash-colored spotted-- mounting the sheep and the female goats, for I have seen how much Laban is doing to you.<verse eid="GEN 31:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:13"/>I am the God who appeared to you at a divine place, there where you anointed a stele to me and made a vow to me there. Now therefore rise, and go forth from this land, and depart to the land of your origin, and I will be with you.'"<verse eid="GEN 31:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:14"/>And Rachel and Leia said to him in reply, "Surely there is no longer a portion or an inheritance in our father's house?<verse eid="GEN 31:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:15"/>Have we not been regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he consumed our money by a devouring.<verse eid="GEN 31:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:16"/>All the wealth and the glory that God took away from our father shall belong to us and to our children. Now therefore do what God has said to you."<verse eid="GEN 31:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:17"/>Then Iakob, when he had arisen, took his wives and his youngsters on the camels,<verse eid="GEN 31:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:18"/>and he carried off all his possessions and all his chattels that he had procured in Mesopotamia and all that was his, to go off to his father Isaak in the land of Chanaan.<verse eid="GEN 31:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:19"/>Now Laban went away to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's idols.<verse eid="GEN 31:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:20"/>And Iakob concealed his intention from<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">31:20</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'his intention from':  Lacking in Greek</char></note> Laban the Syrian so as not to tell him that he was fleeing,<verse eid="GEN 31:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:21"/>and he fled with all that was his and crossed the river and set out for the mountain of Galaad.<verse eid="GEN 31:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:22"/>Then on the third day it was told to Laban the Syrian that Iakob had fled,<verse eid="GEN 31:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:23"/>and taking along all his kinsfolk with himself he followed hard after him a seven days' journey, and he caught up with him at the mountain of Galaad.<verse eid="GEN 31:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:24"/>But God came to Laban the Syrian in his sleep during the night and said to him, "Watch yourself, that you not speak evil with Iakob."<verse eid="GEN 31:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:25"/>And Laban caught up with Iakob. Now Iakob pitched his tent on the mountain, and Laban stationed his kinsfolk on the mountain of Galaad.<verse eid="GEN 31:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:26"/>And Laban said to Iakob, "What have you done? (27) Why did you flee secretly and rob me (26) and carry off my daughters like those captured by dagger?<verse eid="GEN 31:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:27"/>And if you had told me, I would have sent you away with mirth and with music, drums and lyre.<verse eid="GEN 31:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:28"/>I was not deemed worthy to kiss my youngsters and daughters. Now then, you have acted senselessly.<verse eid="GEN 31:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:29"/>And now my hand is strong to harm you, but the God of your father spoke to me yesterday, saying, 'Watch yourself, that you do not speak evil with Iakob.'<verse eid="GEN 31:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:30"/>So now you have gone, for with longing you longed to go off to your father's house. Why did you steal my gods?"<verse eid="GEN 31:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:31"/>And Iakob said to Laban in reply, "Because I said, 'Lest perhaps you take away your daughters from me, and all that is mine.'<verse eid="GEN 31:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:32"/>Discover what I have of yours, and take it." And he did not discover anything with him. And Iakob said, "Anyone with whom you should find your gods shall not live in the presence of our kinsfolk." Now Iakob did not know that his wife Rachel had stolen them.<verse eid="GEN 31:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:33"/>And Laban, when he had gone in, searched in Leia's house and found nothing. And he went out of Leia's house and searched in Iakob's house and in the house of the two maids and found nothing. Then he also entered into Rachel's house.<verse eid="GEN 31:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:34"/>Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them into the camel's packsaddles and sat on them.<verse eid="GEN 31:34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:35"/>And she said to her father, "Do not take it ill, lord; I cannot rise before you, for I have what is customary with women." And Laban searched in the whole house and did not find the idols.<verse eid="GEN 31:35"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:36"/>Then Iakob became angry and quarreled with Laban. And Iakob said to Laban in reply, "What is my crime, and what is my fault, that you have followed hard after me<verse eid="GEN 31:36"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:37"/>and that you have searched all my effects? What have you found of all the effects of your house? Set it here before your kinsfolk and my kinsfolk, and let them decide between us two.<verse eid="GEN 31:37"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:38"/>These twenty years of mine I was with you; your sheep and your female goats were not barren; I did not consume the rams of your sheep;<verse eid="GEN 31:38"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:39"/>that which was caught by wild beasts I have not brought back to you; I would exact from myself what was stolen by day and what was stolen by night;<verse eid="GEN 31:39"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:40"/>by day I would become inflamed by heat and by frost by night, and sleep would withdraw from my eyes.<verse eid="GEN 31:40"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:41"/>These twenty years of mine I was in your household; I was subject to you fourteen years in exchange for your two daughters and six years among your sheep, and you falsified my wage with ten ewe lambs.<verse eid="GEN 31:41"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:42"/>If the God of my father Abraam had not been with me-- even the Fear of Isaak-- you would now have sent me away empty-handed; God saw my humiliation and the labor of my hands and rebuked you yesterday."<verse eid="GEN 31:42"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:43"/>Then in reply Laban said to Iakob, "The daughters are my daughters, and the sons are my sons, and the livestock are my livestock, and all things that you see are mine and my daughters'. What shall I do today for these or for their children whom they have borne?<verse eid="GEN 31:43"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:44"/>Now therefore, come, let us make a covenant, you and I, and it shall become an attestation between you and me." And he said to him, "Look, no one is with us; see, God is a witness between you and me."<verse eid="GEN 31:44"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:45"/>Then Iakob, taking a stone, set it up as a stele.<verse eid="GEN 31:45"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:46"/>And Iakob said to his kinsfolk, "Gather stones." And they gathered stones and made a mound, and they ate and drank there by the mound. (48a) And Laban said to him, "This mound bears witness between you and me today."<verse eid="GEN 31:46"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:47"/>And Laban called it Mound-of-the-witness, but Iakob called it Mound-witness.<verse eid="GEN 31:47"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:48"/>(51) Then Laban said to Iakob, "Here is this mound and the stele that I have set up between you and me; (52a) this mound bears witness, and this stele bears witness." (48b) Therefore its name was called Mound-bears-witness,<verse eid="GEN 31:48"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:49"/>and The-act-of-seeing, about which he said, "May God oversee between you and me, that we shall withdraw one from the other.<verse eid="GEN 31:49"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:50"/>If you shall humiliate my daughters, if you shall take wives in addition to my daughters, beware, no one is with us.<verse eid="GEN 31:50"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:51"/><verse eid="GEN 31:51"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:52"/>For whether I do not cross over to you, or you do not cross over this mound and this stele to me for harm,<verse eid="GEN 31:52"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:53"/>the God of Abraam and the God of Nachor will judge between us."<verse eid="GEN 31:53"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:54"/>And Iakob swore by the Fear of his father Isaak. (54) And Iakob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his kinsfolk, and they ate and drank and slept on the mountain.<verse eid="GEN 31:54"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 31:55"/>(32.1) Then in the morning when Laban had risen, he kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them, and Laban, turning back, departed to his region.<verse eid="GEN 31:55"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:1"/>(2) And Iakob departed on his own way. And looking up he saw a divine camp encamped, and the angels of God met him.<verse eid="GEN 32:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:2"/>(3) Now Iakob, when he saw them, said, "This is a divine camp!" And he called the name of that place Camps.<verse eid="GEN 32:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:3"/>(4) And Iakob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir in the territory of Edom,<verse eid="GEN 32:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:4"/>(5) and he commanded them, saying, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Iakob, 'I have lived with Laban as an alien and stayed until now,<verse eid="GEN 32:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:5"/>(6) and cattle and donkeys and sheep and male and female slaves have come into my possession, and I have sent to tell my lord Esau in order that your servant may find favor before you.'"<verse eid="GEN 32:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:6"/>(7) And the messengers returned to Iacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him."<verse eid="GEN 32:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:7"/>(8) Then Iakob was greatly afraid and perplexed. And he divided the people that were with him and the cattle and the sheep into two companies,<verse eid="GEN 32:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:8"/>(9) and Iakob said, "If Esau should come to one company and eradicate it, then there will be the second company to save itself."<verse eid="GEN 32:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:9"/>(10) And Iakob said, "God of my father Abraam and God of my father Isaak, O Lord who said to me, 'Hurry off to the country of your origin, and I will do you good,'<verse eid="GEN 32:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:10"/>(11) it is sufficient for me because of all the righteousness and because of all the truth that you have brought about for your servant, for with my staff I crossed this Jordan, but now I have become two companies.<verse eid="GEN 32:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:11"/>(12) Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau-- because I am afraid of him-- that he not come smite me and mother with children.<verse eid="GEN 32:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:12"/>(13) Yet you said, 'I will do you great good and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which shall not be counted for multitude.'"<verse eid="GEN 32:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:13"/>(14) And he slept there that night. And from what he was bringing he took presents and sent them off to his brother Esau,<verse eid="GEN 32:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:14"/>(15) two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred sheep, twenty rams,<verse eid="GEN 32:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:15"/>(16) thirty milch camels and their young, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty donkeys and ten foals.<verse eid="GEN 32:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:16"/>(17) And he gave them under control to his servants, a flock separately. And he said to his servants, "Go on ahead of me, and put a space between drove and drove."<verse eid="GEN 32:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:17"/>(18) And he commanded the first, saying, "If Esau my brother should meet you and ask you, saying, 'Whose are you and where are you going, and whose are these going on ahead of you?'<verse eid="GEN 32:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:18"/>(19) you shall say, 'Your servant Iakob's; he has sent presents to my lord Esau, and there he is behind us.' "<verse eid="GEN 32:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:19"/>(20) And he commanded the first and the second and the third and all who were going on behind these flocks, saying, "Speak in accordance with this word to Esau when you find him.<verse eid="GEN 32:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:20"/>(21) And you shall say, 'There is your servant Iakob coming behind us.' "For he said, "I shall propitiate his face with the presents that go on before him, and afterwards I shall see his face, for perhaps he will accept my face."<verse eid="GEN 32:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:21"/>(22) And the presents passed by opposite his face, but he himself slept that night in the camp.<verse eid="GEN 32:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:22"/>(23) And that night, after he had gotten up, he took his two wives and his two maids and his eleven youngsters and crossed the ford of the Iabok.<verse eid="GEN 32:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:23"/>(24) And he took them and crossed the wadi and carried over all that was his.<verse eid="GEN 32:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:24"/>(25) And Iakob was left alone, and a man was wrestling with him until morning.<verse eid="GEN 32:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:25"/>(26) And he saw that he was not powerful against him, and he touched the flat part of his thigh, and the flat part of Iakob's thigh became numb as he wrestled with him.<verse eid="GEN 32:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:26"/>(27) And he said to him, "Send me away, for the dawn has come up." But he said, "I will not send you away, unless you bless me."<verse eid="GEN 32:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:27"/>(28) And he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Iakob."<verse eid="GEN 32:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:28"/>(29) Then he said to him, "Your name shall no longer be called Iakob, but Israel shall be your name, because you have prevailed with a god, and with humans you are powerful."<verse eid="GEN 32:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:29"/>(30) Then Iakob asked and said, "Tell me your name." And he said, "Why do you ask this, my name?" And there he blessed him.<verse eid="GEN 32:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:30"/>(31) And Iakob called the name of that place Divine-form, "For I have seen a god face to face, and my life has been preserved."<verse eid="GEN 32:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:31"/>(32) And the sun rose upon him when he passed by Form-of-God; now he was limping upon his thigh.<verse eid="GEN 32:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 32:32"/>(33) Therefore to this day the sons of Israel shall not eat the sinew that became numb, that is on the flat part of the thigh, because he touched the flat part of Iakob's thigh, the sinew, and it became numb.<verse eid="GEN 32:32"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:1"/>Now when Iakob looked up he saw, and see, his brother Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. And Iakob distributed the youngsters to Leia and Rachel and the two maids<verse eid="GEN 33:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:2"/>and put the two maids with their sons out front, and Leia with her youngsters behind, and Rachel and Ioseph last.<verse eid="GEN 33:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:3"/>But he himself advanced ahead of them and did obeisance upon the ground seven times until he came near his brother.<verse eid="GEN 33:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:4"/>And Esau ran forward to meet him, and embracing him he kissed him and fell upon his neck, and they both wept.<verse eid="GEN 33:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:5"/>And looking up he saw the women and youngsters and said, "What are these to you?" And he said, "The youngsters by which God has shown mercy to your servant."<verse eid="GEN 33:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:6"/>And the maids and their children drew near and bowed down,<verse eid="GEN 33:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:7"/>and Leia and her children drew near and did obeisance, and afterwards Rachel and Ioseph drew near, and they did obeisance.<verse eid="GEN 33:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:8"/>And he said, "What are these to you, all these companies that I have met?" And he said, "That your servant may find favor before you, lord."<verse eid="GEN 33:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:9"/>But Esau said, "I have much, brother; let your property be yours."<verse eid="GEN 33:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:10"/>But Iakob said, "If I have found favor before you, accept my presents through my hands; with regard to this I saw your face, as someone might see a divine face, and you will be pleased with me.<verse eid="GEN 33:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:11"/>Receive my blessings that I have brought to you, because God has shown mercy to me and I have everything." And he urged him, and he received them.<verse eid="GEN 33:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:12"/>And he said, "When we depart, we shall go a direct route."<verse eid="GEN 33:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:13"/>But he said to him, "My lord knows that the youngsters are rather delicate, and the sheep and cows are giving birth for me; so if I should drive them hard for one day, all the cattle will die.<verse eid="GEN 33:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:14"/>Let my lord advance ahead of his servant, whereas I will regain strength on the way in accordance with the leisure of the journey that is before me and in accordance with the pace of the young children until I come to my lord in Seir."<verse eid="GEN 33:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:15"/>Then Esau said, "I shall leave behind with you some of the people who are with me." But he said, "Why is this? It is enough that I have found favor before you, lord."<verse eid="GEN 33:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:16"/>Then Esau turned back on that day to his way to Seir.<verse eid="GEN 33:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:17"/>And Iakob was setting out for Tents, and he made himself dwellings there and made tents for his cattle; therefore he called the name of that place Tents.<verse eid="GEN 33:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:18"/>And Iakob came to Salem, a city of Sikima, which is in the land of Chanaan, when he came from Mesopotamia of Syria, and he encamped facing the city.<verse eid="GEN 33:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:19"/>And from Hemmora, Sychem's father, he acquired for one hundred lambs the portion of the field, there where he had set up his tent,<verse eid="GEN 33:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 33:20"/>and there he set up an altar and invoked the God of Israel.<verse eid="GEN 33:20"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:1"/>Now Dina the daughter of Leia, whom she had borne to Iakob, went out to observe the daughters of the inhabitants.<verse eid="GEN 34:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:2"/>And Sychem the son of Hemmora the Chorrite, the ruler of the land, saw her, and seizing her he lay with her and humbled her.<verse eid="GEN 34:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:3"/>And he attended to the person<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:3</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'soul'</char></note> of Dina the daughter of Iakob, and he loved the maiden and spoke with her according to the maid-en's mind.<verse eid="GEN 34:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:4"/>And Sychem spoke to his father Hemmor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Emmor'</char></note>, saying, "Get me this girl for a wife."<verse eid="GEN 34:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:5"/>Now Iakob heard that the son of Hemmor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:5</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Emmor'</char></note> had defiled his daughter Dina, but his sons were with his livestock in the plain, and Iakob kept silent until they came.<verse eid="GEN 34:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:6"/>And Hemmor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Emmor'</char></note> the father of Sychem went out to Iakob to speak with him.<verse eid="GEN 34:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:7"/>And the sons of Iakob came from the plain. And when they heard, the men were cut to the quick, and it was very painful to them because he had done an unseemly thing in Israel by lying with Iakob's daughter, and it shall not be thus.<verse eid="GEN 34:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:8"/>And Hemmor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:8</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Emmor'</char></note> spoke with them, saying, "My son Sychem has selected your daughter with his soul; give her to him as a wife.<verse eid="GEN 34:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:9"/>Make marriages with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for your sons.<verse eid="GEN 34:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:10"/>And settle among us, and as for the land, see, it is broad before you; settle, and travel for business in it, and acquire property in it."<verse eid="GEN 34:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:11"/>Then Sychem said to her father and to her brothers, "May I find favor before you, and whatever you say, we will give.<verse eid="GEN 34:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:12"/>Increase the bride price<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'bride price':  Perhaps 'dowry'</char></note> very much, and I will give it, just as you tell me, and you shall give me this girl for a wife."<verse eid="GEN 34:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:13"/>But the sons of Iakob answered Sychem and his father Hemmora with deceit and spoke with them, because they had defiled their sister Dina,<verse eid="GEN 34:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:14"/>and Symeon and Leui, Dina's brothers, Leia's sons, said to them, "We will not be able to carry out this matter, to give our sister to a man who has a foreskin, for it is a disgrace to us.<verse eid="GEN 34:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:15"/>In this we will become like you and settle among you, if you, even you, become like us when every male of yours has been circumcised,<verse eid="GEN 34:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:16"/>and we will give our daughters to you, and we will take some of your daughters as wives for us, and we will live beside you, and we will be as one clan.<verse eid="GEN 34:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:17"/>But if you do not listen to us to be circumcised, we will depart, taking our daughters."<verse eid="GEN 34:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:18"/>And their words were pleasing before Hemmor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:18</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Emmor'</char></note> and before Sychem, the son of Hemmor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:18</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Emmor'</char></note>.<verse eid="GEN 34:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:19"/>And the young man did not delay to carry out this matter, for he was devoted to Iakob's daughter. Now he was the most honored of all those in his father's house.<verse eid="GEN 34:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:20"/>So then Hemmor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:20</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Emmor'</char></note> and his son Sychem came to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying,<verse eid="GEN 34:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:21"/>"These people are peaceable with us; let them live on the land and travel it for business, and as for the land, see, it is broad before them. We will take their daughters as wives for us, and we will give them our daughters.<verse eid="GEN 34:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:22"/>Only in this will the people become like us to live with us so as to be one people, when every male of ours is circumcised, as they also have been circumcised.<verse eid="GEN 34:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:23"/>And will not their livestock and their possessions and their quadrupeds be ours? Only in this let us become like them, and they will live with us."<verse eid="GEN 34:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:24"/>And all those going out the gate of their city listened to Hemmor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:24</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Emmor'</char></note> and his son Sychem, and they had the flesh of their foreskin circumcised, every male.<verse eid="GEN 34:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:25"/>Now it came about on the third day, when they were in pain, that the two sons of Iakob, Symeon and Leui, Dina's brothers, took each one his dagger and entered into the city safely and killed every male.<verse eid="GEN 34:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:26"/>They killed both Hemmor<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:26</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'Emmor'</char></note> and his son Sychem with a dagger's edge and took Dina out of Sychem's house and went away.<verse eid="GEN 34:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:27"/>Then the sons of Iakob came upon the casualties and plundered the city in which they<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">34:27</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'city residents'</char></note> had defiled their sister Dina,<verse eid="GEN 34:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:28"/>and they took their sheep and their cattle and their donkeys, both as many as were in the city and as many as were in the plain.<verse eid="GEN 34:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:29"/>And all their slaves and all their chattels and their wives they captured, and they plundered both as many things as were in the city and as many things as were in the dwellings.<verse eid="GEN 34:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:30"/>Then Iakob said to Symeon and Leui, "You have made me hateful so that I am evil to all those inhabiting the land, both among the Chananites and the Pherezites. But as for me, I am few in number, and they, gathering together against me, will chop me up, and I shall be annihilated, I and my house-hold."<verse eid="GEN 34:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 34:31"/>Nevertheless they said, "But shall they treat our sister like a whore?"<verse eid="GEN 34:31"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 35"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:1"/>Now God said to Iakob, "Arise, go up to the place Baithel, and reside there, and make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you were fleeing from the presence of your brother Esau."<verse eid="GEN 35:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:2"/>Then Iakob said to his household and to all those who were with him, "Remove from your midst the foreign gods that are with you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments,<verse eid="GEN 35:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:3"/>and arise, let us go up to Baithel, and let us make an altar there to the God who hearkened to me in a day of distress, who was with me and preserved me on the road that I traveled."<verse eid="GEN 35:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:4"/>And they gave to Iakob the foreign gods that were in their hands and the earrings in their ears, and Iakob hid them under the terebinth in Sikima, and he destroyed them to the present day.<verse eid="GEN 35:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:5"/>And Israel rose up from Sikima, and a divine fear came upon the cities all around them, and they did not go in pursuit after the sons of Israel.<verse eid="GEN 35:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:6"/>Then Iakob came to Louza, which is Baithel, which is in the land of Chanaan, he and all the people who were with him.<verse eid="GEN 35:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:7"/>And there he built an altar and called the name of the place Baithel, for there God had revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from the presence of his brother Esau.<verse eid="GEN 35:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:8"/>Now Debbora, Rebekka's nurse, died under the acorn tree below Baithel, and he called its name Acorn-tree-of-mourning.<verse eid="GEN 35:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:9"/>And God appeared to Iakob again in Louza, when he arrived from Mesopotamia of Syria, and God blessed him.<verse eid="GEN 35:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:10"/>And God said to him, "Your name is Iakob; no longer shall it be called Iakob, but Israel shall be your name."<verse eid="GEN 35:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:11"/>And God said to him, "I am your God: increase, and multiply; nations and gatherings of nations shall be from you, and kings shall come from your loins.<verse eid="GEN 35:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:12"/>And the land that I have given to Abraam and Isaak, I have given it to you; it shall be yours, and I will give this land to your offspring after you."<verse eid="GEN 35:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:13"/>Then God went up from him out of the place where he had spoken with him.<verse eid="GEN 35:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:14"/>And Iakob set up a stele in the place in which he had spoken with him, a stone stele, and he poured out a libation on it and poured oil on it.<verse eid="GEN 35:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:15"/>And Iakob called the name of the place, there at which God had spoken with him, Baithel.<verse eid="GEN 35:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:16"/>(21) Then after Iakob had set out from Baithel, he pitched his tent beyond the tower of Gader. (16) Now it came about when he drew near Chabratha to go to the land of Ephratha, that Rachel gave birth, and she experienced severe birth pangs in the birth.<verse eid="GEN 35:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:17"/>And it came about while she was giving birth with difficulty that the midwife said to her, "Take courage, for this one also is a son for you."<verse eid="GEN 35:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:18"/>And it came about as she was giving up her soul, for she was dying, that she called his name Son-of-my-pain, but his father called him Beniamin.<verse eid="GEN 35:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:19"/>So then Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephratha (this is Bethleem).<verse eid="GEN 35:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:20"/>And Iakob set up a stele at her tomb; this is the stele of Rachel's tomb to the present day.<verse eid="GEN 35:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:21"/>(22) And it came about when Israel dwelt in that land that Rouben went and lay with Balla his father's concubine, and Israel heard, and it seemed evil in his sight.<verse eid="GEN 35:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:22"/>Now the sons of Iakob were twelve.<verse eid="GEN 35:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:23"/>The sons of Leia: Rouben (Iakob's firstborn) , Symeon, Leui, Ioudas, Issachar, Zaboulon.<verse eid="GEN 35:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 35:24"/>And the sons of Rachel: Ioseph and Beniamin.<verse eid="GEN 35:24"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 36:1"/>And these are the generations of Esau (he is Edom).<verse eid="GEN 36:1"/>

  <chapter sid="GEN 37"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:1"/>Now Iakob settled in the land where his father had resided as an alien, in the land of Chanaan.<verse eid="GEN 37:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:2"/>And these are the generations of Iakob. Ioseph, seventeen years of age, used to shepherd the sheep with his brothers, when he was young, with the sons of Balla and with the sons of Zelpha, his father's wives. And Ioseph brought back grievous censure to their father Israel.<verse eid="GEN 37:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:3"/>Now Iakob loved Ioseph more than all his sons, because he was a son of old age to him, and he made him a variegated tunic.<verse eid="GEN 37:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:4"/>But when his brothers saw that their father was cherishing him above all his sons, they hated him and could not speak anything peaceable to him.<verse eid="GEN 37:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:5"/>And when Ioseph had dreamed a dream, he told it to his brothers,<verse eid="GEN 37:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:6"/>and he said to them, "Hear this dream that I dreamed.<verse eid="GEN 37:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:7"/>I imagined we were binding sheaves in the middle of the plain, and my sheaf rose and stood upright; then your sheaves, turning around, did obeisance to my sheaf."<verse eid="GEN 37:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:8"/>And his brothers said to him, "Surely you will not, when reigning, reign over us, or, when exercising dominion, exercise dominion over us?" And they proceeded to hate him more because of his dreams and because of his words.<verse eid="GEN 37:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:9"/>And he saw another dream and related it to his father and to his brothers and said, "See, I have dreamed another dream, as though the sun and the moon and eleven stars were doing obeisance to me."<verse eid="GEN 37:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:10"/>And his father rebuked him and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall we indeed, I and your mother and your brothers, when we come, come to do obeisance upon the ground to you?"<verse eid="GEN 37:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:11"/>And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father closely watched the matter.<verse eid="GEN 37:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:12"/>Now his brothers went to Sychem to pasture their father's sheep.<verse eid="GEN 37:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:13"/>And Israel said to Ioseph, "Are not your brothers herding sheep at Sychem? Come, let me send you to them." And he said to him, "Here I am."<verse eid="GEN 37:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:14"/>And Israel said to him, "Go, see if your brothers and the sheep are well, and tell me." And he sent him from the valley of Chebron, and he came to Sychem.<verse eid="GEN 37:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:15"/>And a man found him wandering in the plain, and the man asked him, saying, "What are you seeking?"<verse eid="GEN 37:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:16"/>And he said, "I seek my brothers; tell me where they are pasturing."<verse eid="GEN 37:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:17"/>And the man said to him, "They have departed from here, for I heard them say, 'Let us go to Dothaim.' "And Ioseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothaim.<verse eid="GEN 37:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:18"/>Now they saw him beforehand from a distance before he came near to them, and they intended to act wickedly to kill him.<verse eid="GEN 37:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:19"/>And they said, each one to his brother, "Here comes that dreamer.<verse eid="GEN 37:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:20"/>So come now, let us kill him and cast him into one of the pits, and we shall say, 'An evil animal has devoured him,' and we shall see what his dreams will be."<verse eid="GEN 37:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:21"/>But when Rouben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands and said, "We shall not smite him in regard to life."<verse eid="GEN 37:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:22"/>And Rouben said to them, "Shed no blood; throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him"-- that he might rescue him out of their hands and restore him to his father.<verse eid="GEN 37:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:23"/>Now it came about when Ioseph came to his brothers, that they stripped Ioseph of the variegated tunic that was around him,<verse eid="GEN 37:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:24"/>and, taking him, they cast him into the pit. Now the pit was empty; it had no water.<verse eid="GEN 37:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:25"/>Then they sat down to eat bread, and looking up with their eyes, they saw, and see, Ismaelite wayfarers were coming from Galaad, and their camels were laden with fragrant substances and<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">37:25</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'both'</char></note> pine resin and oil of myrrh. Now they were traveling to bring them down to Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 37:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:26"/>Then Ioudas said to his brothers, "What advantage is it if we kill our brother and conceal his blood?<verse eid="GEN 37:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:27"/>Come, let us sell him to these Ismaelites, but let our hands not be upon him, because he is our brother and our flesh." And his brothers listened.<verse eid="GEN 37:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:28"/>And some Madienite traders were passing by, and they drew out and brought up Ioseph from the pit and sold Ioseph to the Ismaelites for twenty gold pieces, and they brought Ioseph down to Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 37:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:29"/>Then Rouben returned to the pit, and he did not see Ioseph in the pit, and he tore his clothes.<verse eid="GEN 37:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:30"/>And he returned to his brothers and said, "The youngster is not there<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">37:30</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note>, and I, where shall I yet go?"<verse eid="GEN 37:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:31"/>Then taking Ioseph's tunic, they slaughtered a kid of the goats and stained the tunic with the blood.<verse eid="GEN 37:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:32"/>And they sent the variegated tunic, and they brought it in to their father and said, "This we have found; observe whether it is your son's tunic or not."<verse eid="GEN 37:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:33"/>And he recognized it and said, "It is my son's tunic! An evil animal has devoured him, an animal has seized Ioseph."<verse eid="GEN 37:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:34"/>Then Iakob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his loins, and he was mourning for his son many days.<verse eid="GEN 37:34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:35"/>And all his sons and daughters gathered together and came to comfort him, and he would not be comforted, saying, "I shall go down to Hades to my son, mourning." And his father bewailed him.<verse eid="GEN 37:35"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 37:36"/>Now the Madienites had sold Ioseph in Egypt to Petephres, Pharao's gelding, a chief butcher.<verse eid="GEN 37:36"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 38"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:1"/>Now it came about at that time that Ioudas went down from his brothers and came as far as to a certain Odollamite man whose name was Hiras.<verse eid="GEN 38:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:2"/>And there Ioudas saw a Chananite man's daughter whose name was Saua, and he took her and went in to her.<verse eid="GEN 38:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:3"/>And after she had conceived she bore a son and called his name Er.<verse eid="GEN 38:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:4"/>And after she had conceived again she bore a son and called his name Aunan.<verse eid="GEN 38:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:5"/>And yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Selom. Now she was in Chasbi when she bore them.<verse eid="GEN 38:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:6"/>And Ioudas took for Er his firstborn a wife whose name was Thamar.<verse eid="GEN 38:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:7"/>But Er, Ioudas' firstborn, became wicked in the sight of the Lord, and God killed him.<verse eid="GEN 38:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:8"/>Then Ioudas said to Aunan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and act the part of a brother-in-law, and raise up offspring for your brother."<verse eid="GEN 38:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:9"/>But because Aunan knew that the offspring would not be his, it would come about that he would pour out his semen<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">38:9</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'his semen':  Lacking in Greek</char></note> upon the ground when he would go in to his brother's wife so that he would not give offspring to his brother.<verse eid="GEN 38:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:10"/>Now it seemed evil in the sight of God that he did this, and he put him to death also.<verse eid="GEN 38:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:11"/>Then Ioudas said to his daughter-in-law Thamar, "Stay as a widow in the house of your father until my son Selom becomes full-grown"-- for he said, "Lest perhaps he too should die just like his brothers." And Thamar, after she had departed, stayed in the house of her father.<verse eid="GEN 38:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:12"/>Now the days were multiplied, and the wife of Ioudas, Saua, died, and after Ioudas had been comforted, he went up to Thamna to those shearing his sheep, he and his shepherd Hiras the Odollamite.<verse eid="GEN 38:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:13"/>And it was reported to his daughter-in-law Thamar-- they were saying-- "See, your father-in-law is going up to Thamna to shear his sheep."<verse eid="GEN 38:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:14"/>And taking off from herself the garments of her widowhood, she clothed herself with a light summer garment and adorned herself and sat down near the gates of Ainan, which is on the way past Thamna, for she saw that Selom had become full-grown, yet he did not give her to him as a wife.<verse eid="GEN 38:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:15"/>And when Ioudas saw her he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face, and he did not recognize her.<verse eid="GEN 38:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:16"/>Then he turned aside to her from the way and said to her, "Allow me to come in to you," for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, "What will you give me, if you come in to me?"<verse eid="GEN 38:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:17"/>And he said, "I will send to you a kid of the goats from the flocks." And she said, "If you give a pledge until you send it."<verse eid="GEN 38:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:18"/>And he said, "What pledge shall I give to you?" And she said, "Your ring and your small necklace and the staff that is in your hand." And he gave them to her and went in to her, and she became pregnant by him.<verse eid="GEN 38:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:19"/>And getting up she went away and took off from herself her light summer garment and put on the garments of her widow-hood.<verse eid="GEN 38:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:20"/>Now Ioudas sent the kid from the goats by the hand of his shepherd the Odollamite, to recover the pledge from the woman, and he did not find her.<verse eid="GEN 38:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:21"/>Then he asked the men of the place, "Where is the prostitute who was at Ainan by the road?" And they said, "There was no prostitute here."<verse eid="GEN 38:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:22"/>And he returned to Ioudas and said, "I did not find her, and the people of the place say that there was no prostitute there."<verse eid="GEN 38:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:23"/>And Ioudas said, "Let her have them, but let us not be laughed at; I, for my part, have sent this kid, whereas you have not found her."<verse eid="GEN 38:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:24"/>Now it came about after a period of three months that it was reported to Ioudas-- they were saying-- "Your daughter-in-law Thamar has played the whore, and see, she is with child by whore-dom." Then Ioudas said, "Bring her out, and let her be burned."<verse eid="GEN 38:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:25"/>But as she was being brought she sent to her father-in-law, saying, "By the man whose things these are, I am with child." And she said, "Take note whose is the ring and the small necklace and this staff."<verse eid="GEN 38:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:26"/>Then Ioudas recognized them and said, "Thamar has been justified rather than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Selom." And he did not continue to know her any more.<verse eid="GEN 38:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:27"/>Now it came about at the time she was giving birth, that then she had twins in her womb.<verse eid="GEN 38:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:28"/>And it came about as she was giving birth that the one put forth his hand, and taking it, the midwife bound scarlet material on his hand, saying, "This one will come out earlier."<verse eid="GEN 38:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:29"/>But when he retracted his hand, then immediately out came his brother. And she said, "Why has a barrier been cut through because of you?" And she called his name Phares.<verse eid="GEN 38:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 38:30"/>And afterward his brother came out, upon whom was the scarlet material upon his hand, and she called his name Zara.<verse eid="GEN 38:30"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 39"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:1"/>Now Ioseph was brought down to Egypt, and Petephres, the eunuch of Pharao, a chief butcher, an Egyptian, acquired him from the hand of the Ismaelites, who had brought him down there.<verse eid="GEN 39:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:2"/>And the Lord was with Ioseph, and he was a successful man, and he was in the house with his Egyptian lord.<verse eid="GEN 39:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:3"/>And his lord knew that the Lord was with him and the Lord was prospering whatever he did.<verse eid="GEN 39:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:4"/>And Ioseph found favor before his lord, and he was well pleased with him and appointed<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">39:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'he was well pleased with him and appointed':  Possibly 'was well pleasing to him, and he appointed'</char></note> him over his house and gave everything that he had into Ioseph's control.<verse eid="GEN 39:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:5"/>Now it came about after he had been appointed over his house and over everything that he had, that then the Lord blessed the Egyptian's house for Ioseph's sake, and the Lord's blessing was on all that belonged to him in the house and in the field.<verse eid="GEN 39:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:6"/>And he entrusted everything that he had into Ioseph's hands, and he had no knowledge of any of his own affairs except the bread that he would eat. And Ioseph was handsome in physique and very pleasing in appearance.<verse eid="GEN 39:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:7"/>And it came about after these matters, that then his lord's wife cast her eyes upon Ioseph and said, "Lie with me."<verse eid="GEN 39:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:8"/>But he would not, and he said to his lord's wife, "If, because of me, my lord has no knowledge of anything in his house and he gave everything that he has into my hands<verse eid="GEN 39:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:9"/>and nothing in this household is above me and he has not excluded anything from me except you, because you are his wife, then how shall I carry out this evil matter and sin against God?"<verse eid="GEN 39:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:10"/>And when she would speak to Ioseph day after day, then he would not submit to her to sleep with her in order to have relations with her.<verse eid="GEN 39:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:11"/>Now some such day came: Ioseph went into the house to perform his tasks, and no one of those in the household was inside,<verse eid="GEN 39:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:12"/>and she drew him by his garments, saying, "Lie with me!" And leaving his garments behind in her hands he fled and went outside.<verse eid="GEN 39:12"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 39:14"/>that then she called those who were in her household and spoke to them, saying, "See, he<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">39:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="GEN 39:15"/>And as soon as he heard that I raised my voice and cried out, he fled and went outside, leaving his garments behind with me."<verse eid="GEN 39:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:16"/>And she left his garments with herself until the lord came into his house.<verse eid="GEN 39:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:17"/>And she spoke with him according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you brought in to us, came in to me to mock me and said to me, 'I will lie with you.'<verse eid="GEN 39:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:18"/>But when he heard that I raised my voice and cried out, he left his garments behind with me and fled and went outside."<verse eid="GEN 39:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:19"/>Now it came about when his lord heard the words of his wife that she spoke to him, saying, "Thus your servant did to me," that then he was incensed with anger.<verse eid="GEN 39:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:20"/>And Ioseph's lord, taking him, put him into the stronghold, into the place in which the king's prisoners are confined, there in the stronghold.<verse eid="GEN 39:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:21"/>And the Lord was with Ioseph and poured down mercy upon him, and he gave him favor before the chief jailer,<verse eid="GEN 39:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:22"/>and the chief jailer gave the prison into Ioseph's control, and all who had been led away, who were in the prison, and everything that they were doing there.<verse eid="GEN 39:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 39:23"/>The chief jailer of the prison had no knowledge of anything because of him, for everything was under Ioseph's control, because the Lord was with him, and whatever he would do, the Lord would prosper in his hands.<verse eid="GEN 39:23"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 40"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:1"/>Now it came about after these matters that the chief cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the chief baker transgressed against their lord the king of Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 40:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:2"/>And Pharao became angry with his two eunuchs-- with the chief cupbearer and with the chief baker--<verse eid="GEN 40:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:3"/>and he put them in custody at the chief butcher's place in the prison, in the place, there where Ioseph had been led away.<verse eid="GEN 40:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:4"/>And the chief jailer put them together with Ioseph, and he came to their aid, and they were in the jail for some days.<verse eid="GEN 40:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:5"/>And both saw a dream-- the chief cup-bearer and the chief baker, who belonged to the king of Egypt, who were in the prison-- each one a dream, in a single night was the appearance of his dream.<verse eid="GEN 40:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:6"/>And Ioseph came in to them in the morning, and he saw them, and they were troubled.<verse eid="GEN 40:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:7"/>And he was asking Pharao's eunuchs, who were with him in the jail at his lord's place, saying, "Why is it that your faces are gloomy today?"<verse eid="GEN 40:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:8"/>And they said to him, "We have seen a dream, and there is no one to interpret it." Then Ioseph said to them, "Is not the clarification of them through God? So relate them to me."<verse eid="GEN 40:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:9"/>And the chief cupbearer related his dream to Ioseph and said, "In my sleep a vine was before me.<verse eid="GEN 40:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:10"/>And on the vine were three stems, and it was flourishing, having produced shoots; the grapes of a bunch of grapes were ripe.<verse eid="GEN 40:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:11"/>And Pharao's cup was in my hand, and I took the bunch of grapes and squeezed it out into the cup and gave the cup into Pharao's hands."<verse eid="GEN 40:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:12"/>And Ioseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three stems are three days;<verse eid="GEN 40:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:13"/>yet three days and Pharao will remember your office and restore you to your chief cupbearership, and you shall give Pharao's cup into his hand in accordance with your former office, when you used to pour wine.<verse eid="GEN 40:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:14"/>But remember me through yourself, when it should go well with you, and you shall do mercy with me and make mention of me to Pharao and bring me out of this stronghold.<verse eid="GEN 40:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:15"/>For by stealth I was stolen out of the land of the Hebrews, and here I did nothing, but they put me into this pit."<verse eid="GEN 40:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:16"/>And the chief baker saw that he interpreted rightly, and he said to Ioseph, "I also saw a dream, and I imagined I was taking up on my head three baskets of coarse meal loaves.<verse eid="GEN 40:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:17"/>Now in the topmost basket was baker's work of all sorts, which the king, Pharao, eats, and the fowl of the sky were devouring them from the basket that was atop my head."<verse eid="GEN 40:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:18"/>Then Ioseph said to him in reply, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;<verse eid="GEN 40:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:19"/>within three more days Pharao will take away your head from you and hang you on a pole, and the birds of the sky will eat your pieces of flesh from you."<verse eid="GEN 40:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:20"/>Now it came about on the third day that Pharao had a birthday, and<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">40:20</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'day that Pharao had a birthday, and':  Or 'day-- it was Pharao's birthday-- that then'</char></note> he was making a feast for all his servants. And he remembered the office of the chief cupbearer and the office of the chief baker among his servants.<verse eid="GEN 40:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:21"/>And he restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and he gave the cup into Pharao's hand,<verse eid="GEN 40:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:22"/>but the chief baker he hanged, just as Ioseph had interpreted to them.<verse eid="GEN 40:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 40:23"/>But the chief cupbearer did not remember Ioseph; rather, he forgot him.<verse eid="GEN 40:23"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 41"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:1"/>Now it came about after two years of days that Pharao saw a dream. He imagined he was standing by the river,<verse eid="GEN 41:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:2"/>and look, coming up as it were out of the river were seven cows, fair in form and choice in flesh, and they were grazing in the reed grass.<verse eid="GEN 41:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:3"/>And seven other cows, ugly in form and scrawny in flesh, were coming up out of the river after them and were feeding by the cows by the bank of the river.<verse eid="GEN 41:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:4"/>And the seven cows that were ugly and scrawny in flesh ate up the seven cows that were fair in form and choice. Then Pharao awoke.<verse eid="GEN 41:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:5"/>And he dreamed for the second time, and look, seven ears of grain, choice and fair, were coming up on one stalk.<verse eid="GEN 41:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:6"/>And look, seven ears of grain, scrawny and wind-blasted, were growing up after them.<verse eid="GEN 41:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:7"/>And the seven ears of grain, scrawny and wind-blasted, swallowed up the seven choice and full ears of grain. Then Pharao awoke, and it was a dream.<verse eid="GEN 41:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:8"/>Now morning came, and his soul was troubled, and he sent for and called all the expounders of Egypt and all its wise men, and Pharao related his dream to them, and there was no one to tell it to Pharao.<verse eid="GEN 41:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:9"/>And the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharao, saying, "I recall my fault today.<verse eid="GEN 41:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:10"/>Pharao became angry with his servants and put us in custody in the house of the chief butcher, both me and the chief baker.<verse eid="GEN 41:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:11"/>And we saw a dream in one night, he and I; we saw, each one, in accordance with his own dream.<verse eid="GEN 41:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:12"/>Now a young man was there with us, a Hebrew servant of the chief butcher, and we related them to him, and he interpreted them to us.<verse eid="GEN 41:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:13"/>And it came about that just as he interpreted to us, so also it happened, and thus I was restored to my office, but he was hanged."<verse eid="GEN 41:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:14"/>Then Pharao sent for and called Ioseph, and they brought him out of the stronghold and shaved him and changed his apparel, and he came to Pharao.<verse eid="GEN 41:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:15"/>And Pharao said to Ioseph, "I have seen a dream, and there is no one to interpret it. But I have heard them saying of you that you, on hearing dreams, interpret them."<verse eid="GEN 41:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:16"/>And Ioseph said to Pharao in reply, "Without God the safety of Pharao will not be answered."<verse eid="GEN 41:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:17"/>Then Pharao spoke to Ioseph, saying, "In my dream I imagined I was standing by the bank of the river,<verse eid="GEN 41:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:18"/>and seven cows, choice in flesh and fair in form, were coming up as it were out of the river and were feeding in the reed grass.<verse eid="GEN 41:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:19"/>And look, seven other cows were coming up after them out of the river, worthless and ugly in form and scrawny in flesh, such that I had not seen uglier in the whole land of Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 41:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:20"/>And the seven scrawny and ugly cows ate up the first seven fair and choice cows,<verse eid="GEN 41:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:21"/>and they entered into their bellies, and they did not become distinguishable considering that they entered into their bellies, and their appearances were ugly as also at first. And after I awoke, I fell asleep.<verse eid="GEN 41:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:22"/>And I saw again in my sleep, and as it were seven ears of grain, full and fair, were coming up on one stalk;<verse eid="GEN 41:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:23"/>then seven other ears of grain, scrawny and wind-blasted, were growing up in proximity to them,<verse eid="GEN 41:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:24"/>and the seven scrawny and wind-blasted ears of grain swallowed up the seven fair and full ears of grain. So I spoke to the expounders, and there was no one to tell me."<verse eid="GEN 41:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:25"/>And Ioseph said to Pharao, "Pharao's dream is one; God has shown to Pharao what he is about to do.<verse eid="GEN 41:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:26"/>The seven fair cows are seven years, and the seven fair ears of grain are seven years; Pharao's dream is one.<verse eid="GEN 41:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:27"/>And the seven scrawny cows that were coming up after them are seven years, and the seven scrawny and wind-blasted ears of grain shall be seven years of famine.<verse eid="GEN 41:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:28"/>Now as for the word that I have spoken to Pharao, 'God showed to Pharao what he is about to do,'<verse eid="GEN 41:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:29"/>look, seven years are coming, great plenty in all the land of Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 41:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:30"/>Then afterwards will come seven years of famine, and they will forget the abundance in the whole land of Egypt, and the famine will consume the land,<verse eid="GEN 41:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:31"/>and the plenty will not be observed on the land because of the famine that will be afterwards, for it will be very severe.<verse eid="GEN 41:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:32"/>And as for Pharao's dream being repeated twice: because the matter that is from God will be real, and God will hasten to do it.<verse eid="GEN 41:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:33"/>Now then search out a man, sensible and intelligent, and appoint him over the land of Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 41:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:34"/>And let Pharao make and appoint district governors over the land, and let them take one-fifth of all the produce of the land of Egypt in the seven years of plenty,<verse eid="GEN 41:34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:35"/>and let them gather all the provisions of these seven good years that are coming, and let the grain be gathered under the authority of Pharao; let provisions be kept in the cities.<verse eid="GEN 41:35"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:36"/>And the provisions shall be kept for the land in regard to the seven years of famine that will be in the land of Egypt, and the land will not be annihilated by the famine."<verse eid="GEN 41:36"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:37"/>And the words were pleasing before Pharao and before all his servants,<verse eid="GEN 41:37"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:38"/>and Pharao said to all his servants, "Surely we shall not find such a person, who has a divine spirit within?"<verse eid="GEN 41:38"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:39"/>Then Pharao said to Ioseph, "Seeing that God has shown you all these things, there is no person more sensible and intelligent than you.<verse eid="GEN 41:39"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:40"/>You shall be over my house, and all my people shall comply with your mouth; only with regard to the throne will I be above you."<verse eid="GEN 41:40"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:41"/>And Pharao said to Ioseph, "Look, I am appointing you today over all the land of Egypt."<verse eid="GEN 41:41"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:42"/>And removing his ring from his hand, Pharao placed it on Ioseph's hand and arrayed him in fine linen apparel and placed a gold collar around his neck.<verse eid="GEN 41:42"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:43"/>And he mounted him on the second chariot of those that were his, and a crier cried out in front of him. And he appointed him over the whole land of Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 41:43"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:44"/>And Pharao said to Ioseph, "I am Pharao; without you no one shall lift up a hand in reference to all the land of Egypt."<verse eid="GEN 41:44"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:45"/>And Pharao called Ioseph's name Psonthomphanech, and he gave him Asenneth daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, as a wife for him.<verse eid="GEN 41:45"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:46"/>Now Ioseph was thirty years of age when he stood before Pharao king of Egypt. And Ioseph went out from the presence of Pharao and went through all the land of Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 41:46"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:47"/>And in the seven years of plenty the earth produced sheaves<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">41:47</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'handfuls'</char></note>.<verse eid="GEN 41:47"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:48"/>And he gathered up all the provisions of the seven years, in which there was plenty in the land of Egypt, and put the provisions in the cities; provisions of the plains of the city which were around it he put in it.<verse eid="GEN 41:48"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:49"/>And Ioseph gathered up very much grain-- like the sand of the sea-- until they were unable to count, for there was no counting.<verse eid="GEN 41:49"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:50"/>Now before the seven years of famine came, Ioseph had two sons, whom Asenneth daughter of Petephres, priest of Heliopolis, bore to him.<verse eid="GEN 41:50"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:51"/>And Ioseph called the name of the firstborn Manasse, because "God has caused me to forget all my hardships and all my father's affairs."<verse eid="GEN 41:51"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:52"/>And the name of the second he called Ephraim, because "God has made me increase in the land of my humiliation."<verse eid="GEN 41:52"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:53"/>So the seven years of plenty that occurred in the land of Egypt passed,<verse eid="GEN 41:53"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:54"/>and the seven years of famine began to come, just as Ioseph had said. And famine occurred in all the earth, yet in all the land of Egypt there were bread loaves.<verse eid="GEN 41:54"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:55"/>And all the land of Egypt was hungry, and the people cried to Pharao for bread loaves. Then Pharao said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Ioseph, and whatever he says to you, do."<verse eid="GEN 41:55"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:56"/>And the famine was over the face of all the land, and Ioseph opened all the granaries and was selling to all the Egyptians.<verse eid="GEN 41:56"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 41:57"/>And all the countries came into Egypt to Ioseph to buy, for the famine prevailed in all the earth.<verse eid="GEN 41:57"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 42"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:1"/>Now Iakob, when he saw that there was a sale in Egypt, said to his sons, "Why are you idle?<verse eid="GEN 42:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:2"/>See, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there, and purchase a few provisions for us in order that we may live and not die."<verse eid="GEN 42:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:3"/>And the ten brothers of Ioseph went down to purchase grain from Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 42:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:4"/>But he did not send Ioseph's brother Beniamin with his brothers, for he said, "Lest perhaps sickness befall him."<verse eid="GEN 42:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:5"/>And the sons of Israel came to buy with those who were coming, for the famine was in the land of Chanaan.<verse eid="GEN 42:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:6"/>Now Ioseph was ruler of the land; he was selling to all the people of the land. And when Ioseph's brothers came, they did obeisance to him face down on the ground.<verse eid="GEN 42:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:7"/>And Ioseph, when he saw his brothers, recognized them, and he was keeping himself estranged from them and spoke harshly to them and said to them, "Where have you come from?" And they said, "From the land of Chanaan to buy provisions."<verse eid="GEN 42:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:8"/>Now Ioseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.<verse eid="GEN 42:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:9"/>And Ioseph remembered the dreams that he himself had seen, and he said to them, "You are spies; you have come to scrutinize the tracks of the country!"<verse eid="GEN 42:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:10"/>But they said, "No, lord, your servants came to purchase provisions.<verse eid="GEN 42:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:11"/>We are all sons of one man. We are peaceable; your servants are not spies."<verse eid="GEN 42:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:12"/>Nevertheless he said to them, "No, but you came to see the tracks of the land!"<verse eid="GEN 42:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:13"/>Then they said, "We, your servants, are twelve brothers in the land of Chanaan, and see, the younger is with our father today, and the other is no more."<verse eid="GEN 42:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:14"/>But Ioseph said to them, "This is what I have said to you, saying, 'You are spies!'<verse eid="GEN 42:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:15"/>In this you shall manifest yourselves: by the health of Pharao, you shall not depart from this place unless your younger brother comes here!<verse eid="GEN 42:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:16"/>Send one of you, and take your brother, but as for you, be led away until your words become manifest, whether you are telling the truth or not; otherwise, by the health of Pharao, surely you are spies."<verse eid="GEN 42:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:17"/>And he put them in custody for three days.<verse eid="GEN 42:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:18"/>Then on the third day he said to them, "Do this, and you will live, for I fear God.<verse eid="GEN 42:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:19"/>If you are peaceable, let one brother of you be confined in the jail, but you yourselves go, and carry away the purchase of your grain allowance,<verse eid="GEN 42:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:20"/>and bring your younger brother to me, and your words will be believed; otherwise, you shall die." And they did so.<verse eid="GEN 42:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:21"/>And each one said to his brother, "Indeed, for we are at fault concerning our brother, because we disregarded the affliction of his soul, when he pleaded with us, and we did not listen to him. This is why this affliction has come upon us."<verse eid="GEN 42:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:22"/>Then Rouben said to them in reply, "Did I not speak to you, saying, 'Do not injure the youngster'? And you did not listen to me. And see, his blood is being sought out."<verse eid="GEN 42:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:23"/>Now they did not know that Ioseph was listening, for the interpreter was between them.<verse eid="GEN 42:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:24"/>And turning away from them Ioseph wept. And again he came to them and spoke to them, and he took Symeon from them and bound him before them.<verse eid="GEN 42:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:25"/>Then Ioseph commanded that they fill their containers with grain and to return the money to each one in his sack and to give them a stock of provisions for the journey. And thus it happened to them.<verse eid="GEN 42:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:26"/>And after they had put their grain upon their donkeys, they departed from there.<verse eid="GEN 42:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:27"/>Now when one loosened his bag to give the donkeys fodder where they had lodged, he saw his bundle of money, and it was atop the mouth of the bag.<verse eid="GEN 42:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:28"/>And he said to his brothers, "The money has been returned to me, and, look, this is in my bag!" And their heart was confounded, and they were mutually troubled, saying, "What is this that God has done to us?"<verse eid="GEN 42:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:29"/>And they came to their father Iakob in the land of Chanaan, and they told him all that had befallen them, saying,<verse eid="GEN 42:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:30"/>"The man, the lord of the land, has spoken harshly to us, and he put us in custody as ones spying out the land.<verse eid="GEN 42:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:31"/>But we said to him, 'We are peaceable, we are not spies.<verse eid="GEN 42:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:32"/>We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; the one is no more, and the smaller one is with our father today in the land of Chanaan.'<verse eid="GEN 42:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:33"/>Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I shall know that you are peaceable: leave one brother here with me, and go off, taking the purchase of your house-hold's grain allowance,<verse eid="GEN 42:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:34"/>and bring your younger brother to me-- and I shall know that you are not spies, but that you are peaceable, and I will return your brother to you-- and travel in the land for business.'"<verse eid="GEN 42:34"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:35"/>Now it came about as they were emptying their sacks that then each one's bundle of money was in their sack. And they saw their bundles of money, they and their father, and they were afraid.<verse eid="GEN 42:35"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:36"/>And their father Iakob said to them, "I am the one you have bereaved of children: Ioseph is not, Symeon is not, and you will take Beniamin. All this has come upon me!"<verse eid="GEN 42:36"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:37"/>Then Rouben spoke to his father, saying, "Kill my two sons, if I do not bring him to you. Give him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you."<verse eid="GEN 42:37"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 42:38"/>But he said, "My son shall not go down with you, because his brother died and he alone has been left. And it will turn out that he becomes sick on the journey that you travel, and you will bring down my old age with sorrow to Hades."<verse eid="GEN 42:38"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 43"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:1"/>Now the famine prevailed upon the land.<verse eid="GEN 43:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:2"/>And it came about when they had finished eating up the grain that they had brought from Egypt, that then their father said to them, "Again go purchase a few provisions for us."<verse eid="GEN 43:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:3"/>But Ioudas spoke to him, saying, "With a solemn declaration the man has solemnly declared to us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your younger brother be with you.'<verse eid="GEN 43:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:4"/>If, therefore, you send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you provisions,<verse eid="GEN 43:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:5"/>but if you do not send our brother with us, we will not go, for the man spoke to us, saying, 'You shall not see my face unless your younger brother be with you.' "<verse eid="GEN 43:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:6"/>And Israel said, "Why did you treat me badly by telling the man whether you have a brother?"<verse eid="GEN 43:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:7"/>And they said, "As he was inquiring, the man asked questions about us and our kindred, saying, 'Is your father still alive? Have you a brother?' And we reported to him in accordance with this questioning. Surely we did not know whether he would say to us, 'Bring your brother.' "<verse eid="GEN 43:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:8"/>Then Ioudas said to his father Israel, "Send the youngster with me, and rising, we will go in order that we may live and not die-- both you and we and our dependants.<verse eid="GEN 43:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:9"/>And I am the one who is surety for him; demand him from my hand. If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, I will have failed in regard to you for all days.<verse eid="GEN 43:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:10"/>For if we had not delayed, we would already have returned twice."<verse eid="GEN 43:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:11"/>Then their father Israel said to them, "If it is so, do this: take some of the fruits of the land in your containers, and bring down presents to the man, some pine resin and some honey, incense and oil of myrrh and terebinth and nuts.<verse eid="GEN 43:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:12"/>And take twice the money in your hands; bring back with you the money that was returned in your bags; perhaps it is a mistake.<verse eid="GEN 43:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:13"/>Take your brother also and rise, go down to the man.<verse eid="GEN 43:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:14"/>And may my God grant you favor before the man, and may he send off your one brother and Beniamin. For indeed, as for me, just as I have been bereaved of children, I have been bereaved of children."<verse eid="GEN 43:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:15"/>Now when the men took these presents they also took double the money in their hands, and<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">43:15</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'they also took double the money in their hands, and':  Or 'and double the money, they took with their hands also'</char></note> Beniamin, and rising, they went down into Egypt and stood before Ioseph.<verse eid="GEN 43:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:16"/>And Ioseph saw them and his brother Beniamin, and he said to the one in charge of his household, "Bring the men in to the house, and slaughter animals, and make ready, for the men shall eat bread loaves with me during the noon hour."<verse eid="GEN 43:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:17"/>And the man did just as Ioseph said, and he brought the men in to the house of Ioseph.<verse eid="GEN 43:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:18"/>Now when the men saw that they had been brought in to Ioseph's house, they said, "Because of the money that was returned in our bags at first we are being brought in so that he may accuse us falsely and set upon us, to take us as slaves with our donkeys."<verse eid="GEN 43:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:19"/>And going to the man who was in charge of Ioseph's house, they spoke with him in the gateway of the house,<verse eid="GEN 43:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:20"/>saying, "We plead, lord; we came down at first to purchase provisions.<verse eid="GEN 43:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:21"/>Now it came about when we came to the lodging and opened our bags, that then there was the money of each one in his bag! Our money by weight we have now brought back in our hands,<verse eid="GEN 43:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:22"/>and we have brought with ourselves other money to buy provisions. We do not know who put our money into our bags."<verse eid="GEN 43:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:23"/>But he said to them, "May he be gracious to you; do not be afraid; your God and the God of your fathers gave you treasures in your bags, but I have your good money in full." And he brought Symeon out to them.<verse eid="GEN 43:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:24"/>And he brought water to wash their feet and gave their donkeys fodder.<verse eid="GEN 43:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:25"/>And they made the presents ready until Ioseph came at noon, for they had heard that he was going to have lunch there.<verse eid="GEN 43:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:26"/>And Ioseph came into the dwelling, and they brought to him the presents that they had in their hands-- into the house-- and did obeisance to him face down on the ground.<verse eid="GEN 43:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:27"/>And he asked them, "How are you?" And he said to them, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"<verse eid="GEN 43:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:28"/>And they said, "Your servant our father is well; he is still alive." And he said, "Blessed be that man to God." And bending forward they did obeisance to him.<verse eid="GEN 43:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:29"/>Then looking up with his eyes, he saw his brother Beniamin, born of the same mother, and said, "Is this your younger brother, whom you said you would bring to me?" And he said, "May God show mercy to you, child!"<verse eid="GEN 43:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:30"/>And Ioseph was troubled, for his insides were twisting up over his brother, and he was seeking to weep. And going into the chamber he wept there.<verse eid="GEN 43:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:31"/>Then washing his face and coming out he controlled himself and said, "Serve bread loaves."<verse eid="GEN 43:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:32"/>And they served him alone and them by themselves and the Egyptians who were dining with him by themselves, for the Egyptians could not eat bread loaves together with the Hebrews, for it is an abomination to the Egyptians.<verse eid="GEN 43:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:33"/>And they were seated before him, the firstborn according to his seniority and the younger according to his youth, and the men were amazed, each one to his brother.<verse eid="GEN 43:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 43:34"/>And they carried portions to them from him, but Beniamin's portion was magnified beyond the portions of all, five-fold in comparison to the ones of those. And they drank and became intoxicated with him.<verse eid="GEN 43:34"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 44"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:1"/>And Ioseph commanded the one who was in charge of his household, saying, "Fill the men's bags with provisions, as much as they can carry, and put each one's money at the mouth of his bag,<verse eid="GEN 44:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:2"/>and put my silver cup into the bag of the younger one, with the price of his grain." And it happened according to the word of Ioseph, just as he said.<verse eid="GEN 44:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:3"/>The morning dawned, and the men were sent off, they and their donkeys.<verse eid="GEN 44:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:4"/>Now when they had gone from the city, they were not far off, and Ioseph said to the one in charge of his household, "Rise, pursue after the men, and you shall overtake them and say to them, 'Why is it that you returned evil for good? Why did you steal my silver cup?<verse eid="GEN 44:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:5"/>Is it not this with which my lord drinks? And by ornithomancy he practices ornithomancy with it. You have perpetrated evil in what you have done.'"<verse eid="GEN 44:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:6"/>And when he found them, he spoke to them according to these words.<verse eid="GEN 44:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:7"/>Then they said to him, "Why does our lord speak according to these words? Heaven forbid for your servants to do according to this word!<verse eid="GEN 44:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:8"/>If indeed the money that we found in our bags we brought back to you from the land of Chanaan, how would we steal silver or gold from your lord's house?<verse eid="GEN 44:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:9"/>As for the one among your servants with whom the cup should be found, let him die, but as for us, we will be slaves to our lord."<verse eid="GEN 44:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:10"/>And he said, "Even now, as you say thus it shall be: the one with whom the cup should be found shall be my slave, but as for you, you shall be clear."<verse eid="GEN 44:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:11"/>And each one hurried and lowered his bag to the ground, and each opened his bag.<verse eid="GEN 44:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:12"/>And he was searching, beginning from the elder until he came to the younger, and he found the cup in the bag of Beniamin.<verse eid="GEN 44:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:13"/>And they tore their clothes, and each one put his bag on his donkey, and they returned to the city.<verse eid="GEN 44:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:14"/>Then Ioudas and his brothers came in to Ioseph while he was still there, and they fell on the ground before him.<verse eid="GEN 44:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:15"/>And Ioseph said to them, "What is this deed that you have done? Do you not know that a person such as I will practice ornithomancy by ornithomancy?"<verse eid="GEN 44:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:16"/>And Ioudas said, "What shall we say in answer to our lord or what should we speak or how should we justify ourselves? But God has found out the injustice of your servants. Here we are, our lord's domestics, both we and the one with whom the cup has been found."<verse eid="GEN 44:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:17"/>But Ioseph said, "Heaven forbid for me to carry out this matter! The person with whom the cup was found, he shall be my slave, but as for you, go up in safety to your father."<verse eid="GEN 44:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:18"/>Then Ioudas, drawing near to him, said, "I plead, lord, let your servant speak a word before you, and do not become angry with your servant, because you are after Pharao.<verse eid="GEN 44:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:19"/>Lord, it was you who asked your servants, saying, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'<verse eid="GEN 44:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:20"/>And we said to our lord, 'We have an elderly father, and he has a younger child of his old age, and his brother died, and he alone was left to his mother, and his father loved him.'<verse eid="GEN 44:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:21"/>Then you said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, and I am going to take care of him.'<verse eid="GEN 44:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:22"/>And we said to our lord, 'The youngster will not be able to leave his father behind, and if he should leave his father behind, he will die.'<verse eid="GEN 44:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:23"/>Then it was you who said to your servants, 'Unless your younger brother comes down with you, you shall not continue still to see my face.'<verse eid="GEN 44:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:24"/>And it came about when we went up to your servant, our father, that we told him the words of our lord.<verse eid="GEN 44:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:25"/>Then our father said to us, 'Go again; buy us a few provisions.'<verse eid="GEN 44:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:26"/>But we said, 'We shall not be able to go down; yet if indeed our younger brother goes down with us, we will go down, for we shall not be able to see the man's face, if our younger brother is not with us.'<verse eid="GEN 44:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:27"/>Then your servant our father said to us, 'You know that my wife bore me two.<verse eid="GEN 44:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:28"/>And the one went away from me, and you said that he had come to be eaten by wild beasts, and I have not seen him ever since.<verse eid="GEN 44:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:29"/>So if you take this one also from my presence and sickness befall him on the way, then you will bring down my old age with sorrow to Hades.'<verse eid="GEN 44:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:30"/>So now if I go in to your servant, our father, and the youngster be not with us (now his soul depends upon the soul of this one) ,<verse eid="GEN 44:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:31"/>then it shall be that when he sees the youngster is not with us, he will perish, and your servants will bring down the old age of your servant, our father, with grief to Hades.<verse eid="GEN 44:31"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:32"/>For your servant has become surety for the child with my father, saying, 'If I do not bring him to you and set him before you, I will have failed towards my father for all days.'<verse eid="GEN 44:32"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:33"/>So now I will remain with you as a slave, my lord's domestic, in place of the child, but let the child go up with his brothers.<verse eid="GEN 44:33"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 44:34"/>For how shall I go up to my father, if the child is not with us?-- lest I see the evils that will find my father!"<verse eid="GEN 44:34"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 45"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:1"/>And Ioseph could not bear with all those who were standing by him, but said, "Send all away from me." And no one stood by Ioseph any longer when he was making himself known to his brothers.<verse eid="GEN 45:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:2"/>And he let go his voice with weeping; now all the Egyptians heard it, and it came to be heard in the household of Pharao.<verse eid="GEN 45:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:3"/>And Ioseph said to his brothers, "I am Ioseph. Is my father still alive?" And his brothers could not answer him, for they were troubled.<verse eid="GEN 45:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:4"/>Then Ioseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me." And they came near. And he said, "I am your brother Ioseph, whom you sold into Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 45:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:5"/>Now therefore do not be distressed nor let it seem hard to you that you sold me here, for God sent me before you for life.<verse eid="GEN 45:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:6"/>For famine is on the earth this second year, and there are still five years remaining in which there will be neither plowing nor harvest.<verse eid="GEN 45:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:7"/>For God sent me before you, to leave behind a remnant of you on the earth and to nourish a great posterity of you.<verse eid="GEN 45:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:8"/>Now therefore it is not you who have sent me here, but rather God, and he made me as a father to Pharao and lord of all his house and ruler over all the land of Egypt.<verse eid="GEN 45:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:9"/>So hurry, go up to my father, and say to him, 'This is what your son Ioseph says, God made me lord of all the land of Egypt; so come down to me, and do not remain.<verse eid="GEN 45:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:10"/>And you shall settle in the land of Gesem of Arabia, and you shall be near me, you and your sons and your son's sons, your sheep and your cattle and as much as you have,<verse eid="GEN 45:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:11"/>and I will nourish you there-- for there is famine for five more years-- lest you be annihilated, you and your sons and all your possessions.'<verse eid="GEN 45:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:12"/>Look, your eyes and the eyes of Beniamin my brother see that it is my mouth that speaks to you.<verse eid="GEN 45:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:13"/>So report to my father all my glory in Egypt and how much you have seen and make haste; bring my father down here."<verse eid="GEN 45:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:14"/>And falling upon his brother Beniamin's neck, he wept on him, and Beniamin wept on his neck.<verse eid="GEN 45:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:15"/>And kissing all his brothers, he wept on them, and after that his brothers spoke to him.<verse eid="GEN 45:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:16"/>And the utterance was proclaimed in Pharao's house-- they were saying-- "Ioseph's brothers have come." And Pharao and his retinue were delighted.<verse eid="GEN 45:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:17"/>Then Pharao said to Ioseph, "Say to your brothers, 'Do this: load your transport animals, and go off to the land of Chanaan,<verse eid="GEN 45:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:18"/>and come to me, taking along your father and your possessions, and I will give you some of all the good things of Egypt, and you shall eat the marrow of the land.'<verse eid="GEN 45:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:19"/>And as for you, command these things, to take wagons for them from the land of Egypt-- for your children and wives-- and when you have taken up your father, come.<verse eid="GEN 45:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:20"/>Do not spare your accoutrements with your eyes, for all the good things of Egypt shall be yours."<verse eid="GEN 45:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:21"/>And the sons of Israel did so. And Ioseph gave them wagons in accordance with what was said by Pharao the king, and he gave them a stock of provisions for the journey,<verse eid="GEN 45:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:22"/>and to all he gave two garments, but to Beniamin he gave three hundred gold pieces and five exceptional garments,<verse eid="GEN 45:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:23"/>and to his father he sent the same kinds of things, and ten donkeys carrying some of all the good things of Egypt, and ten mules carrying bread loaves to his father for the journey.<verse eid="GEN 45:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:24"/>Then he sent his brothers off, and they went, and he said to them, "Do not get angry on the way."<verse eid="GEN 45:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:25"/>And they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Chanaan to their father Iakob,<verse eid="GEN 45:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:26"/>and they told him, saying, "Your son Ioseph is alive, and he rules over all the land of Egypt!" And Iakob's mind was confounded, for he did not believe them.<verse eid="GEN 45:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:27"/>And they spoke to him all the things said by Ioseph, as many as he had said to them. And when he saw the wagons that Ioseph had sent so as to take him up, the spirit of their father Iakob was rekindled.<verse eid="GEN 45:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 45:28"/>Then Israel said, "It is a great thing for me if my son Ioseph is still alive. I will go see him before I die."<verse eid="GEN 45:28"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 46"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 46:1"/>Now after Israel had set out, he and all that was his, he came to the well of the oath and offered a sacrifice to the God of his father Isaak.<verse eid="GEN 46:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 46:2"/>Then God said to Israel in a vision of the night (when he had said, "Iakob, Iakob," and he had said, "What is it?") ,<verse eid="GEN 46:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 46:3"/>saying, "I am the God of your fathers; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there,<verse eid="GEN 46:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 46:4"/>and it is I who will go down with you to Egypt, and it is I who will bring you up totally<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">46:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'eventually'</char></note>, and Ioseph shall lay his hands on your eyes."<verse eid="GEN 46:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 46:5"/>Then Iakob rose up from the well of the oath, and the sons of Iakob took up their father Israel and their chattels and their wives on the wagons that Ioseph had sent to carry him,<verse eid="GEN 46:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 46:6"/>and when they had taken up their possessions and every acquisition that they had acquired in the land of Chanaan, then he came into Egypt, Iakob and all his offspring with him,<verse eid="GEN 46:6"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 46:34"/>you shall say, 'We your servants are stockmen from childhood until now, both we and our fathers'-- in order that you may settle in the land of Gesem of<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">46:34</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Wevers Ed. = 'in'</char></note> Arabia, for every shepherd of sheep is an abomination to Egyptians."<verse eid="GEN 46:34"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 47"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:1"/>And Ioseph went and told Pharao, saying, "My father and my brothers with their livestock and cattle and all that is theirs have come from the land of Chanaan, and see, they are in the land of Gesem."<verse eid="GEN 47:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:2"/>And of his brothers he took along five men and set them before Pharao.<verse eid="GEN 47:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:3"/>And Pharao said to Ioseph's brothers, "What is your occupation?" And they said to Pharao, "Your servants are shepherds of sheep, both we and our fathers."<verse eid="GEN 47:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:4"/>And they said to Pharao, "We have come to reside as aliens in the land, for there is no pasture for the livestock of your servants, because the famine has prevailed in the land of Chanaan. Now therefore your servants will settle in the land of Gesem."<verse eid="GEN 47:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:5"/>Then Pharao said to Ioseph, (6) "Let them settle in the land of Gesem, and if you know that there are capable men among them, appoint them as rulers of my livestock." And Iakob and his sons came into Egypt to Ioseph, and Pharao king of Egypt heard. (5) And Pharao spoke to Ioseph, saying, "Your father and your brothers have come to you.<verse eid="GEN 47:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:6"/>See, the land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best land."<verse eid="GEN 47:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:7"/>Then Ioseph brought in his father Iakob and set him before Pharao, and Iakob blessed Pharao.<verse eid="GEN 47:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:8"/>And Pharao said to Iakob, "How many are the years of the days of your life?"<verse eid="GEN 47:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:9"/>And Iakob said to Pharao, "The days of the years of my life during which I am sojourning are one hundred thirty years. Few and grievous have been the days of the years of my life; they did not attain to the days of the years of the life of my fathers, during which days they sojourned."<verse eid="GEN 47:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:10"/>And when Iakob had blessed Pharao, he departed from him.<verse eid="GEN 47:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:11"/>And Ioseph settled his father and brothers and granted them a holding in the land of Egypt, in the best land, in the land of Ramesses, as Pharao had ordered.<verse eid="GEN 47:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:12"/>And Ioseph would measure out grain to his father and brothers and all his father's household, grain per person.<verse eid="GEN 47:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:13"/>Now there was no grain in all the land, for the famine prevailed greatly, and the land of Egypt and the land of Chanaan failed because of the famine.<verse eid="GEN 47:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:14"/>Then Ioseph collected all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Chanaan for the grain that they would buy, and he would measure out grain to them, and Ioseph brought all the money into Pharao's house.<verse eid="GEN 47:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:15"/>And the money from the land of Egypt and from the land of Chanaan failed. Then all the Egyptians came to Ioseph, saying, "Give us bread loaves, and why are we dying in your presence? For our money has failed."<verse eid="GEN 47:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:16"/>And Ioseph said to them, "Bring your livestock, and I will give you bread loaves in exchange for your livestock, if the money has failed."<verse eid="GEN 47:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:17"/>Then they brought their livestock to Ioseph, and Ioseph gave them bread loaves in exchange for the horses and in exchange for the sheep and in exchange for the cattle and in exchange for the donkeys, and in that year he nourished them with bread loaves in exchange for all their livestock.<verse eid="GEN 47:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:18"/>And that year came to an end, and they came to him in the second year and said to him, "Let us not be wiped out by our lord, for if the money has failed and the possessions and the livestock are with you, our lord, then there is nothing left to us in the presence of our lord except our own body and our land.<verse eid="GEN 47:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:19"/>So lest we die in your presence and the land be desolated, acquire us and our land in exchange for bread loaves, and we with our land will be Pharao's slaves; grant seed in order that we may sow and live and not die, and the land will not be desolated."<verse eid="GEN 47:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:20"/>And Ioseph acquired all the land of the Egyptians for Pharao. For the Egyptians sold their land to Pharao, because the famine gained mastery over them. And the land became Pharao's--<verse eid="GEN 47:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:21"/>and the people he subjugated to him as slaves from the furthest boundaries of Egypt to the furthest--<verse eid="GEN 47:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:22"/>except for the land of the priests alone. Ioseph did not acquire it, for by a grant Pharao gave a gift to the priests, and they would eat the grant that Pharao gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.<verse eid="GEN 47:22"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:23"/>So then Ioseph said to all the Egyptians, "See, I have acquired you and your land today for Pharao. Take seed for yourselves, and sow the land,<verse eid="GEN 47:23"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:24"/>and there will be produce from it; you shall give the fifth part to Pharao, but the four parts shall be your very own as seed for the land and as food for you and all those in your households."<verse eid="GEN 47:24"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:25"/>And they said, "You have saved us; we found favor before our lord, and we will be slaves to Pharao."<verse eid="GEN 47:25"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:26"/>And Ioseph imposed it for them as an ordinance upon the land of Egypt, to this day, to give one-fifth to Pharao, except for the land of the priests alone; it was not Pharao's.<verse eid="GEN 47:26"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:27"/>So then Israel settled in the land of Egypt on the land of Gesem, and they gained an inheritance on it and increased and multiplied exceedingly.<verse eid="GEN 47:27"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:28"/>And Iakob survived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and Iakob's days of the years of his life amounted to one hundred forty-seven years.<verse eid="GEN 47:28"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:29"/>Now the days for Israel to die drew near, and he called his son Ioseph and said to him, "If I have found favor before you, put your hand under my thigh, and you shall bring about mercy and truth for me so as not to bury me in Egypt,<verse eid="GEN 47:29"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:30"/>but I will lie down with my fathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place." And he said, "I will do according to your word."<verse eid="GEN 47:30"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 47:31"/>Then he said, "Swear to me." And he swore to him. And Israel did obeisance upon the top of his staff.<verse eid="GEN 47:31"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 48"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:1"/>Now it came about after these matters that then it was told to Ioseph, "Your father is ill." And taking along his two sons, Manasse and Ephraim, he went to Iakob.<verse eid="GEN 48:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:2"/>And it was reported to Iakob-- they were saying-- "See, your son Ioseph is coming to you." And summoning his strength, Israel sat upon the bed.<verse eid="GEN 48:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:3"/>And Iakob said to Ioseph, "My God appeared to me in Louza in the land of Chanaan, and he blessed me<verse eid="GEN 48:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:4"/>and said to me, 'See, I will make you increase and will multiply you and will make you into gatherings of nations and will give to you this land, and to your offspring after you, for a perpetual holding.'<verse eid="GEN 48:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:5"/>Now therefore your two sons, who were born to you in Egypt before I came into Egypt to you, are mine, Ephraim and Manasse; like Rouben and Symeon they shall be mine.<verse eid="GEN 48:5"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:6"/>But the descendants that you may produce hereafter shall be yours; they shall be called after the name of their brothers in their allotments.<verse eid="GEN 48:6"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:7"/>Now as for me, when I was coming from Mesopotamia of Syria, your mother Rachel died in the land of Chanaan, while I was drawing near, by the hippodrome of Chabratha, of the land<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">48:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'Chabratha, of the land':  Perhaps 'the land of Chabratha'</char></note>, to go to Ephratha, and I buried her on the way to the hippodrome," this is Bethleem.<verse eid="GEN 48:7"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:8"/>And Israel, when he saw Ioseph's sons, said, "Who are these to you?"<verse eid="GEN 48:8"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:9"/>And Ioseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." And Iakob said, "Bring them to me in order that I may bless them."<verse eid="GEN 48:9"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:10"/>Now his eyes were heavy-sighted because of old age, and they could not see. And he brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.<verse eid="GEN 48:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:11"/>And Israel said to Ioseph, "See, I was not deprived of your face, and see, God has shown me your offspring also."<verse eid="GEN 48:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:12"/>And Ioseph brought them from his knees, and they did obeisance to him face down upon the earth.<verse eid="GEN 48:12"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:13"/>Then when Ioseph had taken his two sons, both Ephraim in his right hand but on Israel's left, and Manasse in his left hand but on Israel's right, he brought them near him.<verse eid="GEN 48:13"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:14"/>But Israel, stretching out his right hand, laid it on the head of Ephraim-- now he was the younger-- and his left on the head of Manasse, his hands crosswise.<verse eid="GEN 48:14"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:15"/>And he blessed them and said, "The God whom my fathers Abraam and Isaak were well pleasing before, the God who sustains me from my youth to this day,<verse eid="GEN 48:15"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:16"/>the angel who rescues me from all evils, bless these youngsters, and in them my name will be invoked, and the name of my fathers Abraam and Isaak, and may they be multiplied into a great multitude upon the earth."<verse eid="GEN 48:16"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:17"/>Now when Ioseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it seemed grievous to him, and Ioseph took hold of his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasse's head.<verse eid="GEN 48:17"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:18"/>And Ioseph said to his father, "Not so, father; for this one is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head."<verse eid="GEN 48:18"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:19"/>And he would not, but said, "I know, child, I know; this one also shall become a people, and this one shall be exalted, but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his offspring shall become a multitude of nations."<verse eid="GEN 48:19"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:20"/>And he blessed them on that day, saying, "In you Israel will be blessed when they say, 'God make you like Ephraim and like Manasse.'" And he put Ephraim ahead of Manasse.<verse eid="GEN 48:20"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:21"/>Then Israel said to Ioseph, "Look, I am about to die, and God will be with you, and God will bring you back from this land to the land of your fathers.<verse eid="GEN 48:21"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 48:22"/>Now I am giving you Sikima, as something special beyond your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorrites with my dagger and bow."<verse eid="GEN 48:22"/>



  <chapter sid="GEN 49"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 49:1"/>Then Iakob summoned his sons and said: "Gather together in order that I may tell you what will happen to you at the last of the days.<verse eid="GEN 49:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 49:2"/>Assemble, and hear, O sons of Iakob; hear Israel your father.<verse eid="GEN 49:2"/>

  <chapter sid="GEN 50"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 50:1"/>And Ioseph, falling on his father's face, wept over him and kissed him.<verse eid="GEN 50:1"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 50:2"/>And Ioseph ordered his servants, the undertakers, to prepare his father for burial, and the undertakers prepared Israel for burial.<verse eid="GEN 50:2"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 50:3"/>And they completed his forty days, for so the days of burial are reckoned. And Egypt mourned for him seventy days.<verse eid="GEN 50:3"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 50:4"/>Then after the days of mourning had passed, Ioseph spoke to the chief men of Pharao, saying, "If I have found favor before you, speak into the ears of Pharao, saying:<verse eid="GEN 50:4"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 50:5"/>My father made me swear an oath, saying, 'In the tomb that I dug out for myself in the land of Chanaan, there you shall bury me.' Now then I will go up and bury my father, and I will return."<verse eid="GEN 50:5"/>

    <verse sid="GEN 50:10"/>And they arrived at the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and they lamented him with a very great and strong<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">50:10</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'very great and strong':  Or 'great and very strong'</char></note> lamentation, and he made mourning for his father seven days.<verse eid="GEN 50:10"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 50:11"/>And the inhabitants of the land of Chanaan saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad and said, "This is a great mourning to the Egyptians." Therefore one called the name of the place Mourning-of-Egypt, which is beyond the Jordan.<verse eid="GEN 50:11"/>
    <verse sid="GEN 50:12"/>And his sons did thus for him just as he had commanded them, and they buried him there.<verse eid="GEN 50:12"/>
