  <chapter sid="JON 1"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:1"/>And a word of the Lord came to Ionas the son of Amathi, saying,<verse eid="JON 1:1"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:2"/>"Arise, and go to Nineue, the great city, and make a proclamation in it, because the cry of its wickedness has come up to me."<verse eid="JON 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:3"/>And Ionas arose to flee to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord. And he went down to Joppe and found a ship going to Tharsis, and he paid his fare and went on board to sail with them to Tharsis away from the presence of the Lord.<verse eid="JON 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:4"/>And the Lord aroused a wind in the sea, and a great surge came upon the sea, and the ship was in danger of breaking up.<verse eid="JON 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:5"/>And the mariners were afraid and cried out, each to their god. And they heaved the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to be lightened from them. But Ionas went down into the hold of the ship and was sleeping and snoring.<verse eid="JON 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:6"/>And the captain came to him and said to him, "Why are you snoring? Get up, invoke your god in order that the god might deliver us and we not perish."<verse eid="JON 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:7"/>And they said each to his neighbor, "Come, let us cast lots and learn on whose account this calamity is among us. And they cast lots, and the lot fell on Ionas.<verse eid="JON 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:8"/>And they said to him, "Tell us on what account this calamity is among us. What is your occupation? And where do you come from? And from what country are you and of what people?"<verse eid="JON 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:9"/>And he said to them, "I am a slave of the Lord, and I worship the Lord, God of the sky, who made the sea and the dry land."<verse eid="JON 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:10"/>And the men feared with a great fear and said to him, "What is this that you have done!" For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the Lord, because he had told them.<verse eid="JON 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:11"/>And they said to him, "What should we do to you, and the sea will abate from us?" Because the sea kept coming and stirring up a surge even more.<verse eid="JON 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:12"/>And Ionas said to them, "Pick me up, and throw me into the sea, and the sea will abate from you, for I know it is because of me that this great surge is upon you."<verse eid="JON 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:13"/>And the men exerted themselves to return to land, and they could not, because the sea kept coming and stirring up against them more.<verse eid="JON 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:14"/>And they cried out to the Lord and said, "No way, O Lord, do not let us perish on account of this person's life. And do not put upon us just blood, for you, O Lord, have done as you have wished."<verse eid="JON 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:15"/>And they took Ionas and cast him into the sea, and the sea ceased from its tumult.<verse eid="JON 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="JON 1:16"/>And the men feared the Lord in great fear, and they sacrificed a sacrifice to the Lord and vowed vows.<verse eid="JON 1:16"/>



  <chapter sid="JON 2"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:1"/>(1.17) And the Lord ordered a great sea monster to swallow Ionas, and Ionas was in the belly of the sea monster three days and three nights.<verse eid="JON 2:1"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:2"/>(1) And Ionas prayed to the Lord, his God, from the belly of the sea monster<verse eid="JON 2:2"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:3"/>(2) and said, "I cried out to the Lord my God in my affliction, and he heard me; out of the belly of Hades you heard my cry, my voice.<verse eid="JON 2:3"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:4"/>(3) You cast me into the depths of the heart of the sea, and streams surrounded me; all your surges and your billows passed over me.<verse eid="JON 2:4"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:5"/>(4) And I said, 'I have been driven away from your eyes; shall I add to look at your holy shrine?'<verse eid="JON 2:5"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:6"/>(5) Water poured over me as far as my life; the deepest abyss surrounded me; my head sank into the crevices of the mountains.<verse eid="JON 2:6"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:7"/>(6) I went down to the land, whose bars are everlasting barriers, and let the decay of my life ascend, O Lord my God.<verse eid="JON 2:7"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:8"/>(7) As my life was failing me, I remembered the Lord; so may my prayer come to you into your holy shrine.<verse eid="JON 2:8"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:9"/>(8) People who cherish vain and false things have forsaken their mercy.<verse eid="JON 2:9"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:10"/>(9) But I with a voice of praise and acknowledgment will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay to the Lord for my deliverance."<verse eid="JON 2:10"/>
    <verse sid="JON 2:11"/>(10) And the sea monster was ordered, and it cast Ionas out upon dry land.<verse eid="JON 2:11"/>



  <chapter sid="JON 3"/>
    <verse sid="JON 3:1"/>And a word of the Lord came to Ionas a second time, saying,<verse eid="JON 3:1"/>
    <verse sid="JON 3:2"/>"Get up, go to Nineue, the great city, and proclaim in it according to the previous proclamation that I spoke to you.<verse eid="JON 3:2"/>
    <verse sid="JON 3:3"/>And Ionas got up and went to Nineue, as the Lord said. Now Nineue was a great city to God, of about three days' journey.<verse eid="JON 3:3"/>
    <verse sid="JON 3:4"/>And Ionas began to go into the city about one day's journey. And he proclaimed and said, "Three days more and Nineue shall be overthrown!"<verse eid="JON 3:4"/>
    <verse sid="JON 3:5"/>And the men of Nineue believed God and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the great among them unto the small among them.<verse eid="JON 3:5"/>
    <verse sid="JON 3:6"/>And the news reached the king of Nineue, and he rose from his throne, and removed his robe from himself and covered himself with sackcloth and sat on ashes.<verse eid="JON 3:6"/>
    <verse sid="JON 3:7"/>And proclamation was made, and it was spoken in Nineue by the king and his nobles, saying, "Let people and animals and cattle and sheep not taste anything or feed or drink water."<verse eid="JON 3:7"/>
    <verse sid="JON 3:8"/>And the people and animals put on sackcloth, and they cried fervently to God. And they turned, each from his evil way and from the injustice in his hands, saying,<verse eid="JON 3:8"/>
    <verse sid="JON 3:9"/>"Who knows if God will repent and turn from the anger of his wrath and we will not perish?"<verse eid="JON 3:9"/>
    <verse sid="JON 3:10"/>And God saw their deeds, that they turned from their evil ways, and God repented at the calamity which he said he would do to them, and he did not do it.<verse eid="JON 3:10"/>



  <chapter sid="JON 4"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:1"/>And Ionas was grieved with great grief and confused.<verse eid="JON 4:1"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:2"/>And he prayed to the Lord and said, "Ah Lord! Were these not my words while I was still in my country? That is why I had the foresight to flee to Tharsis, for I knew that you are merciful and compassionate, long-suffering and very merciful and one who repents at calamities.<verse eid="JON 4:2"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:3"/>And now, O Sovereign, Lord, take my life from me, because it is better for me to die than to live."<verse eid="JON 4:3"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:4"/>And the Lord said to Ionas, "Are you exceedingly grieved?"<verse eid="JON 4:4"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:5"/>And Ionas went out of the city and sat down opposite the city and made a tent for himself there. And he sat under it in the shade until he should see what would become of the city.<verse eid="JON 4:5"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:6"/>And the Lord God ordered a gourd, and it came up over Ionas's head to be a shade over his head to shade him from his miseries. And Ionas was happy with great happiness about the gourd.<verse eid="JON 4:6"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:7"/>And early the next morning, God ordered a worm, and it smote the gourd, and it withered.<verse eid="JON 4:7"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:8"/>And it came to pass, as soon as the sun rose, God ordered a scorching wind of heat, and the sun beat down on the head of Ionas, and he became disheartened and renounced his life and said, "It is better for me to die than to live."<verse eid="JON 4:8"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:9"/>And God said to Ionas, "Are you exceedingly grieved over the gourd?" And he said, "I am exceedingly grieved, unto death."<verse eid="JON 4:9"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:10"/>And the Lord said, "You had consideration for the gourd, which you suffered no trouble for, and you did not nurture it, which came into being towards nightfall and perished towards nightfall.<verse eid="JON 4:10"/>
    <verse sid="JON 4:11"/>But shall I<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'shall I': Or 'I shall ....'</char></note> not spare Nineue, the great city, in which dwell more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons who did not know their right hand from their left, and many animals?<verse eid="JON 4:11"/>
