  <chapter sid="JDG 1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:1"/>And it came about after the death of Iesous that the sons of Israel were inquiring by the Lord, saying, "Who shall go up for us against the Chananite as leader, to fight against him?"<verse eid="JDG 1:1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:2"/>And the Lord said, "Ioudas shall go up. See, I have given the land in his hand."<verse eid="JDG 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:3"/>And Ioudas said to his brother Symeon, "Come up with me in my allotment, and let us fight against the Chananite, and indeed I will go with you in your allotment." And Symeon went with him.<verse eid="JDG 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:4"/>And Ioudas went up, and the Lord gave the Chananite and the Pherezite in his hand, and he struck them down at Bezek, ten thousand men.<verse eid="JDG 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:5"/>And they found Adonibezek at Bezek and fought against him and struck down the Chananite and the Pherezite.<verse eid="JDG 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:6"/>And Adonibezek fled, and they went in pursuit after him and caught him and cut off the tips of his hands and his feet.<verse eid="JDG 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:7"/>And Adonibezek said, "Seventy kings with the tips of their hands and their feet cut off used to gather the scraps under my table; therefore, as I have done, so God has paid me back." And they brought him to Ierousalem, and he died there.<verse eid="JDG 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:8"/>And the sons of Ioudas fought against Ierousalem and took it. And they struck it down with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire with fire.<verse eid="JDG 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:9"/>And after that the sons of Ioudas went down to fight against the Chananite who lived in the hill country and the south and the lowland.<verse eid="JDG 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:10"/>And Ioudas went against the Chananite who lived in Chebron, and Chebron came out in opposition (now the name of Chebron was formerly Kariatharboksepher) , and he struck down Sesi and Achiman and Tholmi, offspring of Enak.<verse eid="JDG 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:11"/>And from there they went against the inhabitants of Dabir (and the name of Dabir was formerly City of Letters).<verse eid="JDG 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:12"/>And Chaleb said, "Whoever strikes a blow against the City of Letters and captures it first, I will give him my daughter Ascha for a wife."<verse eid="JDG 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:13"/>And Gothoniel son of Kenez, Chaleb's younger brother, captured it first, and he gave him his daughter Ascha for a wife.<verse eid="JDG 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:14"/>And it came about, when she entered, that he urged her to ask for the field from her father. And she grumbled upon her draft animal and cried out from where she was on her draft animal, "You have given me away into the land of the south." And Chaleb said to her, "What do you want?"<verse eid="JDG 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:15"/>And Ascha said to him, "Give me a blessing; since you have given me away into the land of the south, you shall also give me redemption of water." And, according to her desire, Chaleb gave her the redemption of the upper and the redemption of the lower.<verse eid="JDG 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:16"/>And the sons of Iobab the Kinite, Moyses' father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms to the sons of Ioudas, into the wilderness that is in the south near the descent of Arad. And he went and settled with the people.<verse eid="JDG 1:16"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:17"/>And Ioudas went with his brother Symeon, and they struck down the Chananite who inhabited Sepheth and anathematized it and destroyed it. And they called the name of the city Destruction.<verse eid="JDG 1:17"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:18"/>And Ioudas did not inherit Gaza and its territory and Ascalon and its territory and Akkaron and its territory and Azotus and its surrounding lands.<verse eid="JDG 1:18"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:19"/>And the Lord was with Ioudas, and he inherited the hill country, for he could not inherit the inhabitants of the valley, because Rechab commanded it.<verse eid="JDG 1:19"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:20"/>And he gave Chebron to Chaleb, just as Moyses had said, and from there he inherited the three cities and removed from there the three sons of Enak.<verse eid="JDG 1:20"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:21"/>And the sons of Beniamin did not remove the Iebousite who lived in Ierousalem, and the Iebousite has lived with the sons of Beniamin to this day.<verse eid="JDG 1:21"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:22"/>And the sons of Ioseph, indeed they too went up towards Baithel, and Ioudas with them.<verse eid="JDG 1:22"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:23"/>And the house of Israel encamped against Baithel (now the name of the city was formerly Louza).<verse eid="JDG 1:23"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:24"/>And those who were keeping watch saw a man coming out of the city, and they captured him and said to him, "Show us the way into the city, and we will do mercy with you."<verse eid="JDG 1:24"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:25"/>And he showed them the way into the city, and they struck down the city with the edge of the sword, but they sent the man and his family away.<verse eid="JDG 1:25"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:26"/>And the man left for the land of Chettiim and built a city there and called its name Louza; that is its name to this day.<verse eid="JDG 1:26"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:27"/>And Manasses did not inherit Baithshan (which is the city of the Scythians) or its daughters or its surrounding lands or Ekthanaad and its daughters or the inhabitants of Dor and its daughters and the inhabitants of Balaam and its daughters and the inhabitants of Magedon and its daughters or the inhabitants of Ieblaam or its daughters, and the Chananite began to live in that land.<verse eid="JDG 1:27"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:28"/>And it came about that when Israel grew strong, he set the Chananite to pay tribute, and removing he did not remove him.<verse eid="JDG 1:28"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:29"/>And Ephraim did not remove the Chananite who lived in Gazer, and the Chananite was living in his midst in Gazer and became for tribute.<verse eid="JDG 1:29"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 1:33"/>And Nephthali did not remove the inhabitants of Baithsamys or the inhabitants of Baitheneth, and Israel lived in the midst of the Chananite who inhabited the land; now the inhabitants of Baithsamys and the city of Baitheneth became for tribute to them.<verse eid="JDG 1:33"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:34"/>And the Amorrite pressed the sons of Dan back into the hill country, for he did not allow him to come down to the valley.<verse eid="JDG 1:34"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:35"/>And the Amorrite began to live in the mountain of the Myrtle-grove, where there are bears and foxes, and the hand of the house of Ioseph rested heavily on the Amorrite, and he became for tribute.<verse eid="JDG 1:35"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 1:36"/>And the border of the Amorrite was the Idumean above Akrabin, near Petra and above.<verse eid="JDG 1:36"/>



  <chapter sid="JDG 2"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:1"/>Now an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to Weeping and to Baithel and to the house of Israel, and he said to them, "The Lord, the Lord brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that he had sworn to your fathers to give to you. And he said to you, 'I will not scatter my covenant with you forever.<verse eid="JDG 2:1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:2"/>And for your part, you shall not make a covenant with those who have their seat in this land, nor shall you do obeisance to their gods, but you shall destroy their carved objects<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'images'</char></note> and tear down their altars.' And you did not listen to my voice when you did these things.<verse eid="JDG 2:2"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:3"/>And I said, I will not add to deport the people of whom I spoke, to destroy them from before you, and they shall be for causes of oppression to you, and their gods shall be for an obstacle to you."<verse eid="JDG 2:3"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:4"/>And it came about, as the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all Israel, that the people lifted up their voice and wept.<verse eid="JDG 2:4"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:5"/>For this reason the name of that place was called Weeping, and there they sacrificed to the Lord.<verse eid="JDG 2:5"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:6"/>And Iesous dismissed the people, and the sons of Israel went away, each to his house and to his inheritance to inherit the land.<verse eid="JDG 2:6"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:7"/>And the people were subject to the Lord all the days of Iesous and all the days of the elders, those who prolonged their days after Iesous, those who had known all the Lord's great work that he had done for Israel.<verse eid="JDG 2:7"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:8"/>And Iesous son of Naue, slave of the Lord, died, a son of one hundred and ten years.<verse eid="JDG 2:8"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:9"/>And they buried him within the bounds of his inheritance in Thamnathares, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaas.<verse eid="JDG 2:9"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:10"/>And that whole generation was added to their fathers, and another generation arose after them, those who did not know the Lord and the work that he had done for Israel.<verse eid="JDG 2:10"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:11"/>And the sons of Israel did what was evil before the Lord and were serving the Baalim,<verse eid="JDG 2:11"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:12"/>and they abandoned the Lord, god of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they went after other gods from among the gods of the peoples who were all around them and did obeisance to them, and they provoked the Lord to anger.<verse eid="JDG 2:12"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:13"/>And they abandoned the Lord and served the she-Baal and the Astartes.<verse eid="JDG 2:13"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:14"/>And the Lord was furiously angry with Israel, and he delivered them in the hand of plunderers, and they plundered them, and he gave them up in the hand of their enemies all around, and they could not withstand in the presence of their enemies.<verse eid="JDG 2:14"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:15"/>At every point at which they would prostitute themselves, the Lord's hand also was to them for misfortune, as the Lord had said and as the Lord had sworn, and he oppressed them greatly.<verse eid="JDG 2:15"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:16"/>And the Lord raised up judges for them and delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them.<verse eid="JDG 2:16"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:17"/>And indeed they did not listen to their judges, for they prostituted themselves after other gods and did obeisance to them and provoked the Lord to anger. And they soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the Lord; they did not do so.<verse eid="JDG 2:17"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:18"/>And because the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord also was with the judge, and he delivered them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge, for the Lord was entreated by their groaning from before those who besieged and afflicted them.<verse eid="JDG 2:18"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:19"/>And it came about when the judge would die that they relapsed and again caused corruption beyond what their fathers had done, going after other gods, serving them and doing obeisance to them. They did not cast off their practices and they did not withdraw from their stubborn way.<verse eid="JDG 2:19"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:20"/>And the Lord was furiously angry against Israel, and he said, "Seeing that, inasmuch as this nation has abandoned my covenant that I commanded their fathers and has not obeyed my voice,<verse eid="JDG 2:20"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:21"/>I for my part will not add to remove from before them a man from among the nations that Iesous left behind and let be,<verse eid="JDG 2:21"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:22"/>to test Israel by means of them, whether or not they would keep to the way of the Lord, walking in it, as their fathers had kept to it."<verse eid="JDG 2:22"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 2:23"/>And the Lord had let those nations be, not removing them at once, and had not delivered them in Iesous' hand.<verse eid="JDG 2:23"/>



  <chapter sid="JDG 3"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:1"/>And Iesous left these nations so as to test Israel by means of them, all those who had no experience of all the wars of Chanaan<verse eid="JDG 3:1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:2"/>(only on account of the generations of the sons of Israel, to teach them war; only, those before them did not know them) :<verse eid="JDG 3:2"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:3"/>the five satrapies of the allophyles and the full number of the Chananite and the Sidonian and the Heuite who lived on Lebanon, from Mount Balaermon as far as Loboemath.<verse eid="JDG 3:3"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:4"/>And it happened so as to test Israel by means of them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moyses.<verse eid="JDG 3:4"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:5"/>And the sons of Israel lived in the midst of the Chananite and the Chettite and the Amorrite and the Pherezite and the Heuite and the Iebousite,<verse eid="JDG 3:5"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:6"/>and they took their daughters for wives for themselves, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they served their gods.<verse eid="JDG 3:6"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:7"/>And the sons of Israel did what was evil before the Lord, and they forgot the Lord, their God, and served the she-Baalim and the sacred groves.<verse eid="JDG 3:7"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:8"/>And the Lord was furiously angry against Israel, and he gave them up into the hands of King Chousarsathom of Syria-of-Rivers, and they were subject to him eight years.<verse eid="JDG 3:8"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:9"/>And the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord, and the Lord raised up a deliverer for Israel, and he delivered them, Gothoniel son of Kenez, Chaleb's younger brother, and he obeyed him.<verse eid="JDG 3:9"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:10"/>And a spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel, and he went out to war, and the Lord gave King Chousarsathom of Syria in his hand, and his hand prevailed over Chousarsathom.<verse eid="JDG 3:10"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:11"/>And the land had rest fifty years. And Gothoniel son of Kenez died.<verse eid="JDG 3:11"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:12"/>And the sons of Israel added to do what was evil before the Lord, and the Lord strengthened King Eglom of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil before the Lord.<verse eid="JDG 3:12"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:13"/>And he brought to him all the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and he went and struck down Israel, and he inherited the City of Palms.<verse eid="JDG 3:13"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:14"/>And the sons of Israel were subject to King Eglom of Moab eighteen years.<verse eid="JDG 3:14"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:15"/>And the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord, and the Lord raised up for them a deliverer, Aod son of Gera son of Iemeni, an ambidextrous man. And the sons of Israel sent gifts to King Eglom of Moab by his hand.<verse eid="JDG 3:15"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:16"/>And Aod made for himself a double-bladed dagger, a span in length, and he fastened it on his right thigh under his cloak.<verse eid="JDG 3:16"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:17"/>And he presented the gifts to King Eglom of Moab. And Eglom was a very handsome man.<verse eid="JDG 3:17"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:18"/>And it came about, when Aod had finished presenting the gifts, that he sent those who bore the gifts on their way.<verse eid="JDG 3:18"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:19"/>And Eglom turned back from the carved objects<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'images'</char></note> with Galgal. And Aod said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And Eglom said to everyone, "Away!" and all his attendants went out from him.<verse eid="JDG 3:19"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:20"/>And Aod came in to him, and he was sitting alone, quite by himself in his summer roof-chamber. And Aod said, "I have a divine message for you, O king." And Eglom rose from his seat, near to him.<verse eid="JDG 3:20"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:21"/>And it came about just as he rose up that Aod reached with his left hand and took the dagger from his right thigh and thrust it into Eglom's belly,<verse eid="JDG 3:21"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:22"/>and indeed he even drove the hilt in after the flame, and the fat closed over the flame, for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly.<verse eid="JDG 3:22"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:23"/>And Aod went out into the vestibule, and he closed the doors of the roof-chamber on him and wedged them.<verse eid="JDG 3:23"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:24"/>And he had gone out, and his servants came in. And they looked, and see, the doors of the roof-chamber were locked. And they said, "Perhaps he is sitting on the stool in the retreat of his bedroom."<verse eid="JDG 3:24"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:25"/>And they waited, embarrassed. And see, there was no one to open the doors of the roof-chamber, and they took the key and opened, and see, their lord was lying dead on the ground.<verse eid="JDG 3:25"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:26"/>And Aod escaped while they were in confusion (and there was no one paying attention to him) and he passed beyond the carved objects<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:26</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'images'</char></note> and escaped to Seirotha.<verse eid="JDG 3:26"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:27"/>And it came about when he arrived that he sounded with a horn in the hill country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel went down with him, and he himself was at their head.<verse eid="JDG 3:27"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:28"/>And he said to them, "Come down after me, for the Lord God has given your enemies, Moab, in your hand." And they went down after him and quickly seized the fords across the Jordan of Moab, and they did not allow a man to cross over.<verse eid="JDG 3:28"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:29"/>And at that time they struck down Moab, about ten thousand men, all the warriors among them, even every man of power, and not a man escaped.<verse eid="JDG 3:29"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:30"/>And Moab was humbled in that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years. And Aod judged them until he died.<verse eid="JDG 3:30"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 3:31"/>And after him arose Samegar son of Anath, and he struck down the allophyles, fully six hundred men, as well as calves of cattle. And he himself delivered Israel.<verse eid="JDG 3:31"/>



  <chapter sid="JDG 4"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:1"/>And the sons of Israel added to do what was evil before the Lord.<verse eid="JDG 4:1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:2"/>And the Lord gave them up in the hand of King Iabin of Chanaan, who reigned in Hasor, and the commander of his force was Sisara, and he himself lived in Harisoth-of-the-Nations.<verse eid="JDG 4:2"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:3"/>And the sons of Israel cried out to the Lord, for he had nine hundred ironclad chariots and himself cruelly oppressed Israel for twenty years.<verse eid="JDG 4:3"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:4"/>And at that time a woman, Debbora, a prophetess, wife of Laphidoth, was judging Israel by herself.<verse eid="JDG 4:4"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:5"/>And she used to sit by herself under the palm of Debbora between Rama and between Baithel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel would come up to her there to resolve disputes.<verse eid="JDG 4:5"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:6"/>And Debbora sent and summoned Barak son of Abineem from Kedes Nephthali and said to him, "Is it not you whom the Lord, the God of Israel, commanded? And you shall leave for Mount Thabor and bring with you ten thousand men from the sons of Nephthali and from the sons of Zaboulon.<verse eid="JDG 4:6"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:7"/>And I will bring out to you, to the Wadi Kison, Sisara, commander of Iabin's force, and his chariots and his horde, and I will give him in your hand."<verse eid="JDG 4:7"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:8"/>And Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go, and if you will not go with me, I will not go, for I do not know the day in which the Lord will send his angel on a good journey with me."<verse eid="JDG 4:8"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:9"/>And Debbora said to him, "Going I will go with you, but know that it will not be your success for the journey on which you are going, for the Lord will give Sisara up in the hand of a woman." And Debbora got up and went with Barak to Kedes.<verse eid="JDG 4:9"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:10"/>And Barak summoned Zaboulon and Nephthali to Kedes, and ten thousand warriors went up at his heels, and Debbora went up with him.<verse eid="JDG 4:10"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:11"/>And the fellows of the Kinite had separated from the sons of Iobab, a relative by marriage<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'relative by marriage':  Or 'father-in-law'</char></note> of Moyses, and he had pitched his tent by Oak-of-the-Resters, which is near Kedes.<verse eid="JDG 4:11"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:12"/>And they told Sisara that Barak son of Abineem had gone up to Mount Thabor,<verse eid="JDG 4:12"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:13"/>and Sisara called out all his chariots, for he had nine hundred ironclad chariots, and all the people who were with him, from Harisoth-of-the-Nations, to the Wadi Kison.<verse eid="JDG 4:13"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:14"/>And Debbora said to Barak, "Up! For this is the day in which the Lord has given Sisara in your hand. See, will the Lord not go before you?" And Barak went down from Mount Thabor, and ten thousand men behind him.<verse eid="JDG 4:14"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:15"/>And the Lord threw Sisara and all his chariots and all his camp into a panic by the edge of the sword before Barak, and Sisara got down from his chariot and fled away on his feet,<verse eid="JDG 4:15"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:16"/>and Barak was pursuing after the chariots and after the camp, all the way to Thicket-of-the-Nations. And all the camp of Sisara fell by the edge of the sword; not even one was left.<verse eid="JDG 4:16"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:17"/>And Sisara had retreated on his feet to the tent of Iael, wife of Chaber the Kinite, for there was peace between King Iabin of Hasor and between the clan of Chaber the Kinite.<verse eid="JDG 4:17"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:18"/>And Iael came out to meet Sisara and said to him, "Come aside, my lord, come aside to me; have no fear." And he came aside to her, into the tent, and she covered him with her skin curtain.<verse eid="JDG 4:18"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:19"/>And Sisara said to her, "Do but give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty." And she opened the skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered up his face.<verse eid="JDG 4:19"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:20"/>And he said to her, "Stand at the entrance of the tent, and it shall be, if anybody comes to you and asks you and says to you, 'Is a man within?' that you will say, 'There is not.'" And she covered him up with her skin curtain.<verse eid="JDG 4:20"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:21"/>And Iael, wife of Chaber, took the tent peg and placed the hammer in her hand and quietly went in towards him and hammered the peg into his jaw and drove it through in the ground. And as for him, he writhed between her knees, and he breathed his last and died.<verse eid="JDG 4:21"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:22"/>And see, Barak was pursuing Sisara, and Iael went out to meet him and said to him, "Come here, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." And he went in to her, and see, Sisara, a fallen corpse, and the tent peg in his jaw.<verse eid="JDG 4:22"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:23"/>And the Lord God humbled King Iabin of Chanaan in that day before the sons of Israel.<verse eid="JDG 4:23"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 4:24"/>And the hand of the sons of Israel went out, going and becoming hard against King Iabin of Chanaan until they destroyed him.<verse eid="JDG 4:24"/>



  <chapter sid="JDG 5"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 5:1"/>And Debbora sang, and Barak son of Abineem, in that day and said:<verse eid="JDG 5:1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 5:2"/>"When chiefs take the lead in Israel, when people make their free choice, bless the Lord!<verse eid="JDG 5:2"/>

  <chapter sid="JDG 6"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:1"/>And the sons of Israel did what was evil before the Lord, and the Lord gave them up in the hand of Madiam seven years.<verse eid="JDG 6:1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:2"/>And the hand of Madiam prevailed over Israel, and the sons of Israel made for themselves, from before Madiam, shelters in the mountains and in the caves and the strongholds.<verse eid="JDG 6:2"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:3"/>And it came about whenever a man of Israel put in seed that Madiam would come up, and Amalek and the sons of the east, and they would come up against him.<verse eid="JDG 6:3"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:4"/>And they would encamp against them, and they destroyed the produce of the land, until one comes to Gaza, and they would not leave support for life in Israel, even flock and calf and donkey.<verse eid="JDG 6:4"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:5"/>For they and their livestock would come up, and they would bring their tents, and they would arrive like a grasshopper in great numbers, and there was no number for them or their camels, and they would arrive in the land of Israel to waste it.<verse eid="JDG 6:5"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 6:20"/>And the angel of the Lord said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them by that rock, and pour out the broth." And he did so.<verse eid="JDG 6:20"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:21"/>And the angel of the Lord reached out the tip of the rod that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes, and fire ignited from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes, and the angel of the Lord departed from his sight.<verse eid="JDG 6:21"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:22"/>And Gedeon perceived that it was an angel of the Lord, and Gedeon said, "Ah, ah, Lord, Lord! For I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face."<verse eid="JDG 6:22"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:23"/>And the Lord said to him, "Peace be to you; do not be afraid that you will die."<verse eid="JDG 6:23"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:24"/>And Gedeon built an altar there to the Lord and called it, Peace of the Lord, it being still at Ephratha of Ezri's father to this day.<verse eid="JDG 6:24"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:25"/>And it came about in that night that the Lord said to him, "Take your father's fattened calf, the seven-year-old one. And you will pull down the altar of Baal that is your father's and cut down the sacred grove that is beside it,<verse eid="JDG 6:25"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:26"/>and you will build an altar to the Lord your God, who appeared to you on the peak of this Mount Maoz, in proper order, and you will take the calf and offer up a whole burnt offering with the wood of the sacred grove that you shall cut down."<verse eid="JDG 6:26"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:27"/>And Gedeon took thirteen men from among his slaves and did as the Lord had told him, and it came about, since he was afraid of his father's household and the men of the city, so as not to do it by day, that he did it by night.<verse eid="JDG 6:27"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:28"/>And the men of the city arose early in the morning, and see, the altar of Baal broken down, and the sacred grove beside it cut down, and the fattened calf offered up for a whole burnt offering on the altar that had been built!<verse eid="JDG 6:28"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:29"/>And a man said to his fellow, "Who has done this deed?" And they were searching and seeking, and they said, "Gedeon son of Ioas did this deed."<verse eid="JDG 6:29"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:30"/>And the men of the city said to Ioas, "Bring out your son, and let him die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal and because he has cut down the sacred grove beside it."<verse eid="JDG 6:30"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:31"/>And Ioas said to the men who were arrayed against him, "Are you now acting as judges for Baal? Or are you delivering him?

    <verse sid="JDG 6:32"/>And in that day he called it Baal's Court of Justice, because he pulled down his altar.<verse eid="JDG 6:32"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:33"/>And all Madiam and Amalek and the sons of the east gathered together and crossed and encamped in the Valley of Iezrael.<verse eid="JDG 6:33"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:34"/>And a divine spirit entered Gedeon, and he sounded with a horn and called out for Abiezer after him.<verse eid="JDG 6:34"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:35"/>And he sent out messengers throughout all Manasses, and he himself called out after him. He also sent out messengers in Aser and in Zaboulon and in Nephthali, and they went up to meet him.<verse eid="JDG 6:35"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:36"/>And Gedeon said to God, "If you are delivering Israel by my hand, as you have spoken,<verse eid="JDG 6:36"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 6:38"/>And it was so. And Gedeon rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece, and the dew flowed out of the fleece, a full basin of water.<verse eid="JDG 6:38"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:39"/>And Gedeon said to God, "Let not your anger be aroused against me, and I will speak one more time, and I will make trial with the fleece one more time, and let there be dryness only on the fleece, but over all the ground let there be dew."<verse eid="JDG 6:39"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 6:40"/>And God did so in that night. And there was dryness on the fleece only, but over all the ground there was dew.<verse eid="JDG 6:40"/>



  <chapter sid="JDG 7"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:1"/>And Ierobaal (he is Gedeon) rose early, and all the people that were with him, and encamped beside the land of Aroed, and the camp of Madiam and Amalek was north of him, away from the hill of Abor, in the valley.<verse eid="JDG 7:1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:2"/>And the Lord said to Gedeon, "The people with you are numerous; so I will not give up Madiam in their hand. Israel would only boast against me, saying, 'My own hand has delivered me.'"<verse eid="JDG 7:2"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:3"/>And the Lord said to him, "Do proclaim in the hearing of the people, saying, 'Who is faint-hearted and fearful? Let him return home.'" And twenty-two thousand quickly set out from Mount Galaad and returned home from the people, and ten thousand remained.<verse eid="JDG 7:3"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:4"/>And the Lord said to Gedeon, "The people are still numerous; take them down into the water, and I will test them for you there. And it will be that anyone of whom I say to you, 'This one shall go with you,' he shall go with you, and anyone of whom I say to you that he shall not go with you, he shall not go with you."<verse eid="JDG 7:4"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:5"/>And he brought the people into the water, and the Lord said to Gedeon, "Everyone who laps from the water with his tongue as if a dog laps, you shall put him to one side, and every one who kneels down on his knees to drink, you shall put him by himself."<verse eid="JDG 7:5"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:6"/>And the full number of those that lapped with their tongue was three hundred men, and all the rest of the people knelt down on their knees to drink water.<verse eid="JDG 7:6"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:7"/>And the Lord said to Gedeon, "With the three hundred men that lapped I will deliver you and give Madiam up in your hand. And let all the people depart, a man to his place."<verse eid="JDG 7:7"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:8"/>And they took the provisions of the people in their hand, and their horns, and he sent every man of Israel away, a man to his dwelling, but retained the three hundred men. Now the camp of Madiam was below him in the valley.<verse eid="JDG 7:8"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:9"/>And it happened in that night that the Lord said to him, "Get up, go down quickly from here into the camp, for I have given it up in your hand.<verse eid="JDG 7:9"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:10"/>But if you fear to go down, you and your young servant Phara go down into the camp,<verse eid="JDG 7:10"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:11"/>and you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened, and you shall go down into the camp." And he went down, he and his young servant Phara within the bounds of the fifty in the camp.<verse eid="JDG 7:11"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:12"/>And Madiam and Amalek and all the sons of the east had encamped in the valley like a grasshopper, in great numbers, and there was no number for their camels, but they were like the sand on the seashore, in great numbers.<verse eid="JDG 7:12"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:13"/>And Gedeon entered, and see, a man was telling his dream to his comrade, and he said, "See, the dream which I dreamed, and see, a cake of barley bread was tumbling in the camp of Madiam, and it came to the tent of Madiam and struck it and overturned it, and the tent collapsed."<verse eid="JDG 7:13"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:14"/>And his comrade answered and said, "This is nothing other than the sword of Gedeon son of Ioas, a man of Israel; the Lord has given up Madiam and all the camp in his hand."<verse eid="JDG 7:14"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:15"/>And it came, about when Gedeon heard the narration of the dream and its interpretation, that he did obeisance to the Lord, and he returned to the camp of Israel and said, "Get up, for the Lord has given the camp of Madiam in your hands."<verse eid="JDG 7:15"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:16"/>And he divided the three hundred men into three commands and put horns in the hand of all of them and empty jars and torches in the middle of the jars.<verse eid="JDG 7:16"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:17"/>And he said to them, "You will see from me and do the same. And see, I am going into the middle of the camp, and it will be that as I do, so you shall do.<verse eid="JDG 7:17"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:18"/>And I shall sound with the horn, I and all those with me, and you also shall sound with your horns around the camp and say, 'For the Lord and for Gedeon!'"<verse eid="JDG 7:18"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:19"/>And Gedeon and a hundred men with him entered in the bounds of the camp at the beginning of the midnight watch; however, he roused the guards with a rousing, and they sounded with the horns and shook out the jars that were in their hands.<verse eid="JDG 7:19"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:20"/>And the three commands sounded with the horns and broke the jars and grasped the torches in their left hand, and in their right hand were the horns to sound, and they cried, "A sword for the Lord and for Gedeon!"<verse eid="JDG 7:20"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:21"/>And everyone stood in his place all around the camp, and they ran, all the camp, and they gave signals and fled.<verse eid="JDG 7:21"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:22"/>And the three hundred horns sounded, and the Lord set a man's dagger against his fellow and against all the camp, and the camp fled as far as Baithasetta and was pressed back as far as the edge of Abelmeoula and by Tabath.<verse eid="JDG 7:22"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:23"/>And a man of Israel sounded the cry from Nephthalim and from Aser and from all Manasses, and they took up the pursuit after Madiam.<verse eid="JDG 7:23"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:24"/>And Gedeon sent messengers throughout all the territory of Ephraim, saying, "Come down to meet Madiam, and seize the water for yourselves as far as Baithbera and the Jordan." And every man of Ephraim sounded the cry, and they quickly seized the water as far as Baithbera and the Jordan.<verse eid="JDG 7:24"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 7:25"/>And they captured the two commanders of Madiam, Oreb and Zeb, and they killed Oreb at Sourin, and Zeb they killed at Iakeph-Zeb, and they pursued Madiam. And they brought the head of Oreb and Zeb to Gedeon, from beyond the Jordan.<verse eid="JDG 7:25"/>



  <chapter sid="JDG 8"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 8:1"/>And a man of Ephraim said to him, "Why have you done this thing to us, not to call us when you were setting out to fight against Madiam?" And they disputed with him forcefully.<verse eid="JDG 8:1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 8:2"/>And he said to them, "What have I done now as you have? Are not the gleanings of the grapes of Ephraim better things than the vintage of Abiezer?<verse eid="JDG 8:2"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 8:3"/>God has given up in your hand the commanders of Madiam, Oreb and Zeb, and what have I been able to do as you have?" And they desisted. Then their spirit abated because of him, when he spoke this word.<verse eid="JDG 8:3"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 8:4"/>And Gedeon came to the Jordan and crossed over, he and the three hundred men with him, faint and famished.<verse eid="JDG 8:4"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 14:4"/>And his father and his mother did not know that it was from the Lord, for he himself was seeking requital from the allophyles. And at that time allophyles had dominion over the sons of Israel.<verse eid="JDG 14:4"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 14:15"/>And it came about in the fourth day that they said to Sampson's wife, "Do deceive your husband, and let him tell you the problem, or we will burn you and your father's house with fire. Did you invite us to be beggars?"<verse eid="JDG 14:15"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 14:16"/>And Sampson's wife wept before him and said to him, "You hate me, and you do not love me, for the problem which you set for the sons of my people, even to me you have not told it." And Sampson said to her, "Look, I have not told it to my father or my mother, and am I going to tell you?"<verse eid="JDG 14:16"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 14:17"/>And she wept before him during the seven days, them on which there was a party, and it came about in the seventh day that he told her, because she exasperated him. And she told the sons of her people.<verse eid="JDG 14:17"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 14:18"/>And the men of the city said to him in the seventh day before the sun went down, "What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion?" And Sampson said to them, "If you had not ploughed with my heifer, you would not have found my problem."<verse eid="JDG 14:18"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 14:19"/>And a spirit of the Lord made straight for him, and he went down to Ascalon. And from there he struck down thirty men and took their robes and gave them to those who had told the problem. And Sampson was furiously angry, and he went back to his father's house.<verse eid="JDG 14:19"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 14:20"/>And Sampson's wife lived with his bridal escort, who was his companion.<verse eid="JDG 14:20"/>



  <chapter sid="JDG 15"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:1"/>And it came about after days, during the days of the wheat harvest, that Sampson went to visit his wife, bringing along a kid of goats. And he said, "I will go in to my wife, into the bedroom." And her father would not allow him to go in to her.<verse eid="JDG 15:1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:2"/>And her father said, "Saying I said that hating you hated her, and I gave her to your companion. See, is not her younger sister better than she? Do let her be to you in her stead."<verse eid="JDG 15:2"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:3"/>And Sampson said to him, "I am without blame from the allophyles this once, for the fact that I do mischief with you."<verse eid="JDG 15:3"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:4"/>And Sampson went and caught three hundred foxes and took torches, and he bound tail to tail and put one torch between the two tails, in the middle.<verse eid="JDG 15:4"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:5"/>And he set fire to the torches, and he sent the foxes off into the standing grain of the allophyles and burned up the ears of grain and what had been previously harvested, from the sheaf up to what stood and up to vineyard and olive trees.<verse eid="JDG 15:5"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:6"/>And the allophyles said, "Who has done these things?" And they said, "Sampson, the son-in-law of the Thamnathite, because he took his wife and gave her to his companion." And the allophyles came up and burned her father's house along with her and her father with fire.<verse eid="JDG 15:6"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:7"/>And Sampson said to them, "If you act thus, I will not be content unless I take my revenge from each and every one of you."<verse eid="JDG 15:7"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:8"/>And he struck them on the thigh, a great blow, and he went down and was staying by the wadi in the cave of Etam.<verse eid="JDG 15:8"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:9"/>And the allophyles came up and encamped against Ioudas, and they were thrown back at Lechi.<verse eid="JDG 15:9"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 15:11"/>And three thousand men of Ioudas went down to the hole in the rock of Etam, and they said to Sampson, "Do you not know that the allophyles are ruling over us? And why have you done these things to us?" And Sampson said to them, "As they did to us, so I have done to them."<verse eid="JDG 15:11"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:12"/>And they said to him, "We have come down to bind you and to give you into the hands of the allophyles." And Sampson said to them, "Swear to me not to kill me yourselves and give me up to them, lest you yourselves come against me."<verse eid="JDG 15:12"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:13"/>And they swore to him, saying, "No, but we will bind you with a binding and give you into their hands, but we will not put you to death by death." And they bound him with two new cords and led him up from the rock.<verse eid="JDG 15:13"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:14"/>And he came by himself as far as Jawbone, and the allophyles shouted in triumph to meet him and ran to meet up with him, and a spirit of the Lord made straight for him, and the cords that were on his arms became like flax when it smells fire, and the bonds were loosed from his arms.<verse eid="JDG 15:14"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:15"/>And he found a jawbone of a donkey thrown by the wayside and stretched out his hand and took it, and with it he struck down a thousand men.<verse eid="JDG 15:15"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:16"/>And Sampson said, "I have wiped them out, wiping them out with a donkey's jawbone, for with the donkey's jawbone I have struck down a thousand men."<verse eid="JDG 15:16"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:17"/>And it came about, when he had finished speaking, that he threw the jawbone from his hand, and he called that place Jawbone's Slaying.<verse eid="JDG 15:17"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:18"/>And he was very thirsty, and he called out to the Lord and said, "You have granted this great deliverance by the hand of your slave. And now, shall I die by thirst and fall in the hand of the uncircumcised?"<verse eid="JDG 15:18"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:19"/>And God opened the wound of the jawbone, and waters came from it. And he drank, and his spirit returned in him, and he revived. Therefore its name was called Spring-Summoned-by-Jawbone, as it remains to this day.<verse eid="JDG 15:19"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 15:20"/>And he judged Israel in the days of the allophyles twenty years.<verse eid="JDG 15:20"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 16:3"/>And Sampson lay until midnight. And about midnight he rose up and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two posts and pulled them up, Bar and all, and put them on his shoulder and carried them to the top of the mountain that faces the front of Chebron and set them down there.<verse eid="JDG 16:3"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 16:17"/>And he told her everything from his heart and said to her, "A razor will not come upon my head, for I have been a nazirite of God from my mother's belly. And if I am shaved, my strength will leave me, and I will become weak and be as all men are."<verse eid="JDG 16:17"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 16:18"/>And Dalila realized that he had told her everything from his heart. And she sent and called all the satraps of the allophyles, saying, "Come up this once, for he has told his whole heart to me." And all the satrapies of the allophyles came up to her and brought the money in their hands.<verse eid="JDG 16:18"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 16:19"/>And she lulled him to sleep between her knees, and she called a barber, and he shaved off the seven locks of his head. And he began to weaken, and his strength left him.<verse eid="JDG 16:19"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 16:26"/>and Sampson said to the lad who held him by the hand, "Do let me rest, and make me feel the pillars, those on which the house rests, and I will lean against them." Now the boy did so.<verse eid="JDG 16:26"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 16:27"/>Now the house was full of men and women, and all the satraps of the allophyles were there, and on top of the house there were about three thousand men and women, watching Sampson being made fun of.<verse eid="JDG 16:27"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 16:30"/>And Sampson said, "Let my soul die with the allophyles." And he leaned with strength, and the house fell on the satraps and on all the people who were in it. And the dead whom Sampson put to death at his death were more numerous, above those he had put to death during his life.<verse eid="JDG 16:30"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 16:31"/>And his brothers and all his father's house came down and took him and went up and buried him between Saraa and between Esthaol in the tomb of his father Manoe. And he himself judged Israel twenty years.<verse eid="JDG 16:31"/>

  <chapter sid="JDG 18"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:1"/>In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of Dan was seeking an inheritance for itself to live in. For up to those days no inheritance had fallen to their lot in the midst of the tribes of Israel.<verse eid="JDG 18:1"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:2"/>And the sons of Dan sent out five men from their clans, from part of them, sons of power, from Saraa and Esthaol, to spy out the land and to explore it, and they said to them, "Go, and search out the land." And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, as far as the house of Micha, and they rested there.<verse eid="JDG 18:2"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:3"/>While they were near Micha's house, they also themselves recognized the voice of the young lad, the Leuite, and they went over and said to him, "Who brought you here? And what are you doing here, and what is your business here?"<verse eid="JDG 18:3"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:4"/>And he said to them, "Micha did such and such for me, and he hired me, and I became for a priest to him."<verse eid="JDG 18:4"/>

    <verse sid="JDG 18:7"/>And the five men went on, and they came to Laisa, and they observed the people who were living in it, settled in hope, according to the decision<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">18:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'constitution'</char></note> of the Sidonians, resting in hope and unable to speak a word, for they were far from Sidon and had no word with Syria.<verse eid="JDG 18:7"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:8"/>And the five men came to their brothers at Saraa and Esthaol and their brothers were saying to them, "Why are you sitting down?"<verse eid="JDG 18:8"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:9"/>And they said, "Get up, and let us go up against them. For we have entered and journeyed about in the land as far as Laisa, and we saw the people who live in it in hope, according to the judgment<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">18:9</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'constitution'</char></note> of the Sidonians: and they were far away, away from Sidon, and they had no word with Syria.

    <verse sid="JDG 18:12"/>and went up and encamped at Kariathiarim in Ioudas. On this account that place is called Dan's Camp to this day; see, it is behind Kariathiarim.<verse eid="JDG 18:12"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:13"/>From there they passed on and came as far as the hill country of Ephraim and came as far as the house of Micha.<verse eid="JDG 18:13"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:14"/>And the five men who were going to spy out the land answered and said to their brothers, "Do you know that in these buildings there are ephoud, theraphin<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">18:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'images' or 'household gods'</char></note>, a carved object<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">18:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'image'</char></note> and a cast object<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">18:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'image'</char></note>?

    <verse sid="JDG 18:19"/>And they said to him, "Keep quiet! Put your hand over your mouth, and come with us, and you will be to us for a father and for a priest. Is it better that you should be priest to the house of one man than that you should become priest to a tribe and clan in Israel?"<verse eid="JDG 18:19"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:20"/>And the priest's heart was glad.

    <verse sid="JDG 18:21"/>And they turned around and departed and placed the children and the possession and the weighty item in front of them.<verse eid="JDG 18:21"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:22"/>They themselves went a long distance from the home of Michaias, and see, Michaias and the men in the houses with Michaias' house raised a shout and caught up with the sons of Dan.<verse eid="JDG 18:22"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:23"/>And the sons of Dan turned their face around and said to Michaias, "What is the matter that you shouted out?"<verse eid="JDG 18:23"/>
    <verse sid="JDG 18:24"/>And Michaias said, "Because you took my carved object<note caller="â–¼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">18:24</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'image'</char></note> that I made and the priest, and departed, and what have I left?
