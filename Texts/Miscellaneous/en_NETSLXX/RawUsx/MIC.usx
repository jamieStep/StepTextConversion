  <chapter sid="MIC 1"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:1"/>And a word of the Lord came to Michaias, the Morasthi, in the days of Kings Ioatham and Achaz and Hezekias of Ioudas, regarding the things that he saw concerning Samaria and concerning Ierousalem.<verse eid="MIC 1:1"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:2"/>Hear words, you people, and let the earth pay attention, and all those in it, and the Lord shall be a witness against<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'among'</char></note> you, the Lord from his holy house.<verse eid="MIC 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:3"/>For behold, the Lord is coming out of his place and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth.<verse eid="MIC 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:4"/>And the mountains will quake under him, and the valleys will melt like wax from before the fire and like water being carried in a descent.<verse eid="MIC 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:5"/>All this is for the impiety of Iakob and for the sin of the house of Israel. What is the impiety of Iakob? Is it not Samaria? And what is the sin of the house of Ioudas? Surely it is Ierousalem?<verse eid="MIC 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:6"/>And I will make Samaria an orchard-guard's shed in the field and a planting of a vineyard. And I will pull down her stones into a chasm, and her foundations I will uncover.<verse eid="MIC 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:7"/>And all her carved images they shall cut to pieces, and all her wages they shall burn with fire, and all her idols I will make an annihilation. For from the wages of whoredom she gathered them, and from the wages of whoredom she brought them together.<verse eid="MIC 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:8"/>For this she shall lament and wail; she shall go unshod and naked; she shall make lamentation like that of dragons and mourning like that of the daughters of Sirens.<verse eid="MIC 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:9"/>Because her blow has taken hold, for it has come as far as Ioudas and has reached as far as the gate of my people, as far as Ierousalem.<verse eid="MIC 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:10"/>Do not consider yourselves great, you in Geth; do not rebuild out of a house a laughingstock, you in Akim; besprinkle your laughingstock with soil.<verse eid="MIC 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:11"/>Though she inhabits her cities well, inhabiting Sennaan did not come out to mourn a house next to her; she shall receive a painful blow from you.<verse eid="MIC 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:12"/>Who made a beginning of good things for her who dwells in pain? Because bad things have come down from the Lord to the gates of Ierousalem:<verse eid="MIC 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:13"/>noise of chariots and of horsemen. She who dwells in Lachis, she is the originator of sin for daughter Sion, because in you were found the impious acts of Israel.<verse eid="MIC 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:14"/>Therefore you shall give worthless houses-- ones being dispatched-- as far as the inheritance of Geth. It<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'Geth'</char></note> became meaningless to the kings of Israel.<verse eid="MIC 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:15"/>Until I lead the heirs to you, O inheritance inhabiting [Lachis], the glory of daughter Israel will come as far as Odollam.<verse eid="MIC 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 1:16"/>Shave, and cut your hair for your pampered children; broaden your widowhood like an eagle, because they were taken captive from you.<verse eid="MIC 1:16"/>



  <chapter sid="MIC 2"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:1"/>They came devising troubles and working out evil deeds on their beds. And as soon as it was day, they would execute them, for they did not lift their hands to God.<verse eid="MIC 2:1"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:2"/>And they would covet fields and plunder orphans and oppress households, and they would plunder a man and his house, a man and his inheritance.<verse eid="MIC 2:2"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:3"/>Therefore this is what the Lord says: Behold, I am devising evil against this tribe from which you shall not remove your necks nor walk upright suddenly, because it is an evil time.<verse eid="MIC 2:3"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:4"/>On that day a parable shall be taken up against you, and a dirge will be wailed with a tune, saying, "We suffered misery in misery; a portion of my people was measured by a line, and there was none to prevent him from turning away. Our fields were parceled out."<verse eid="MIC 2:4"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:5"/>Therefore you will have no one to cast the line by lot in the assembly of the Lord.<verse eid="MIC 2:5"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:6"/>"Stop weeping with tears, nor let them shed tears over these matters, for he will not repel reproaches."<verse eid="MIC 2:6"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:7"/>One says, "The house of Iakob provoked the spirit of the Lord." If these are his practices, are not his words good with him, and have they not proceeded upright?<verse eid="MIC 2:7"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:8"/>And previously, my people resisted in hostility; contrary to his peace they stripped off his skin to remove hope in the crushing of war.<verse eid="MIC 2:8"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:9"/>Therefore, leaders of my people shall be cast out of their homes of luxury. On account of their evil practices, they have been expelled. Draw near to the everlasting mountains.<verse eid="MIC 2:9"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:10"/>Arise, and go, because this rest is not for you, due to uncleanness. You were corrupted with corruption;<verse eid="MIC 2:10"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:11"/>you were pursued without anyone pursuing. A spirit established a lie; it dripped on you as wine and intoxicating drink. And it shall be that from the drop of this people,<verse eid="MIC 2:11"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:12"/>when Iakob is being gathered, he will be gathered together with all. Receiving I will receive those remaining of Israel; I will establish their return at the same time. Like sheep in affliction, like a flock in the midst of their stall, they shall leap away from people.<verse eid="MIC 2:12"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 2:13"/>They have cut through the breach before them, and they passed through the gate and went out through it. And their king went out before them, but the Lord shall lead them.<verse eid="MIC 2:13"/>



  <chapter sid="MIC 3"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:1"/>And he will say: Do hear this, you progenitors of the house of Iakob and you that are left of the house of Israel! Should you not know judgment--<verse eid="MIC 3:1"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:2"/>you who hate the good things and seek the evil things, who snatch their skin from them, and their flesh from their bones?<verse eid="MIC 3:2"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:3"/>As they devoured the flesh of my people and flayed their skin off them and crushed their bones and cut them in pieces like meat in a cauldron, like flesh in a cauldron.<verse eid="MIC 3:3"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:4"/>Thus they will cry to the Lord, and he will not listen to them, and he will turn his face from them at that time, because they did evil against them<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the people'</char></note> in their practices.<verse eid="MIC 3:4"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:5"/>This is what the Lord says against the prophets who lead my people astray, who bite with their teeth and announce peace to him, and nothing has been given into their mouth; they have raised up war against him<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:5</char><char closed="false" style="ft">', and nothing has been given into their mouth; they have raised up war against him':  I.e. 'the people'</char></note>.<verse eid="MIC 3:5"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:6"/>Therefore, it shall be night to you without vision and darkness to you without divination. The sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them;<verse eid="MIC 3:6"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:7"/>those who see dreams shall be disgraced, and the diviners shall be mocked; they shall all speak against them, for no one will listen to them.<verse eid="MIC 3:7"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:8"/>Otherwise I will replenish strength in the spirit of the Lord, and of judgment and of dominance to declare to Iakob his impious acts and to Israel his sins.<verse eid="MIC 3:8"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:9"/>Do hear this, you leaders of the house of Iakob and you that are left of the house of Israel, who abhor judgment and pervert the upright things,<verse eid="MIC 3:9"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:10"/>who build Sion with blood and Ierousalem with injustice!<verse eid="MIC 3:10"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:11"/>Her leaders were judging for gifts, and her priests were giving answer for a wage, and her prophets were divining for money, and they were relying on the Lord, saying, "Is the Lord not with<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'among'</char></note> us? No harm shall come upon us."<verse eid="MIC 3:11"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 3:12"/>Therefore, on your account Sion shall be plowed as a field, and Ierousalem shall become like a garden- watcher's hut, and the mountain of the house shall become a grove of a thicket.<verse eid="MIC 3:12"/>



  <chapter sid="MIC 4"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:1"/>And it shall be in the last days, the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, prepared on the tops of the mountains, and it shall be elevated beyond the hills. And peoples shall hasten to it,<verse eid="MIC 4:1"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:2"/>and many nations shall come and say: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of the God of Iakob, and they will show us his way, and we will walk in his paths." Because out of Sion shall go forth a law, and a word of the Lord from Ierousalem.<verse eid="MIC 4:2"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:3"/>And he shall judge between many peoples and shall reprove strong nations far away, and they shall cut their swords into plows and their spears into sickles, and nation shall no longer lift up sword against nation, and they shall learn war no more,<verse eid="MIC 4:3"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:4"/>and each one shall rest under his vine, and each under his fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the Lord Almighty has spoken this.<verse eid="MIC 4:4"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:5"/>Because all the peoples will walk, each in its own way, but we will walk in the name of the Lord, our God, forever and anon.<verse eid="MIC 4:5"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:6"/>In that day, says the Lord, I will assemble her who is shattered, and I will welcome her who is rejected and those whom I drove away.<verse eid="MIC 4:6"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:7"/>And I will make her who is shattered a remnant, and her who is driven away a strong nation, and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Sion from now and forever.<verse eid="MIC 4:7"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:8"/>And you, O dusty tower of the flock, daughter Sion, to you it shall come, and the former dominion, a kingdom out of Babylon, shall enter daughter Ierousalem.<verse eid="MIC 4:8"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:9"/>And now why did you know harm? You did not have a king, did you? Or did your counsel perish, because pangs subdued you like one in labor?<verse eid="MIC 4:9"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:10"/>Suffer pain, and be courageous, and draw near, O daughter Sion, like one in labor, for now you shall go forth from the city and tent in the plain, and you shall come as far as Babylon. From there he will rescue you, and from there the Lord your God will redeem you from the hand of your enemies.<verse eid="MIC 4:10"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:11"/>And now many nations have assembled against you, those who say, "We shall rejoice, and our eyes shall behold Sion."<verse eid="MIC 4:11"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:12"/>They too did not know the thought of the Lord, and they did not understand his plan, that he has gathered them as sheaves of a threshing floor.<verse eid="MIC 4:12"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 4:13"/>Arise, and thresh them, O daughter Sion, because I will make your horns iron and your hoofs I will make bronze, and you shall dissolve many peoples and shall devote their multitude to the Lord and their strength to the Lord of the whole earth.<verse eid="MIC 4:13"/>



  <chapter sid="MIC 5"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:1"/>Now a daughter will be blocked with a blockage; he set up a siege against us; with a rod they shall strike the tribes of Israel upon the cheek.<verse eid="MIC 5:1"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:2"/>And you, O Bethleem, house of Ephratha, are very few in number to be among the thousands of Ioudas; one from you shall come forth for me to become a ruler in Israel, and his goings forth are from of old, from days of yore.<verse eid="MIC 5:2"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:3"/>Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor shall bring forth, and the rest of their brothers shall return to the sons of Israel.<verse eid="MIC 5:3"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:4"/>And he shall stand and see and tend his flock in the strength of the Lord. And they shall exist in the glory of the name of the Lord their God, for now he shall be great to the ends of the earth,<verse eid="MIC 5:4"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:5"/>and this shall be peace. When Assour comes against our land and when he treads upon our country, seven shepherds shall also be raised up against him, and eight stings of people.<verse eid="MIC 5:5"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:6"/>And they shall tend Assour with a sword and the land of Nebrod with her ditch; and he shall rescue us<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">5:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note> from Assour, when he comes against our land and when he treads upon our borders.<verse eid="MIC 5:6"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:7"/>And the remnant of Iakob among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, shall be like dew falling from the Lord and like lambs in the grass that none among sons of man may assemble or resist.<verse eid="MIC 5:7"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:8"/>And the remnant of Iakob among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, shall be like a lion among animals in the forest and like a whelp among flocks of sheep, as when it passes through and, having made a selection, snatches away, and there is none to deliver.<verse eid="MIC 5:8"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:9"/>Your hand shall be exalted over those who oppress you, and all your enemies shall be utterly destroyed.<verse eid="MIC 5:9"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:10"/>It shall come to pass in that day, says the Lord, I will utterly destroy your horses from among you and will demolish your chariots,<verse eid="MIC 5:10"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:11"/>and I will utterly destroy the cities of your land and remove all your strongholds,<verse eid="MIC 5:11"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:12"/>and I will remove your sorceries from your hands, and there will be no speakers of apothegms among you,<verse eid="MIC 5:12"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:13"/>and I will destroy your carved images and your steles from among you, and you shall do obeisance no more to the works of your hands,<verse eid="MIC 5:13"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:14"/>and I will cut off your sacred groves from among you and annihilate your cities.<verse eid="MIC 5:14"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 5:15"/>And in anger and wrath I will execute vengeance on the nations, due to the fact they did not listen.<verse eid="MIC 5:15"/>



  <chapter sid="MIC 6"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:1"/>Do hear a word of the Lord. The Lord said: Rise, plead your case before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.<verse eid="MIC 6:1"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:2"/>Hear, you peoples, the judgment of the Lord, and you chasms, foundations of the earth, because the Lord has a case against his people, and he will dispute with Israel.<verse eid="MIC 6:2"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:3"/>"O my people, what have I done to you? Or how did I sadden or how did I annoy you? Answer me!<verse eid="MIC 6:3"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:4"/>For I brought you up from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from a house of slavery, and I sent before you Moyses and Aaron and Mariam.<verse eid="MIC 6:4"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:5"/>O my people, do remember what King Balak of Moab planned against you and what Balaam son of Beor answered him from the reeds as far as Galgal, that the justice of the Lord might be known."<verse eid="MIC 6:5"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:6"/>"With what should I lay hold of the Lord; shall I lay claim to my God Most High? Shall I lay hold of him with whole burnt offerings, with calves a year old?<verse eid="MIC 6:6"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:7"/>Will the Lord receive favorably among thousands of rams or among ten thousands of swollen streams? Should I give my firstborns for impious acts, the fruit of my belly for the sin of my soul?"<verse eid="MIC 6:7"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:8"/>Has it been told to you, O man, what is good or what the Lord seeks from you, but to do judgment and to love mercy and to be ready to walk with the Lord, your God?<verse eid="MIC 6:8"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:9"/>The voice of the Lord will be invoked for the city, and he shall save those who fear his name. Hear, O tribe, and who shall adorn a city?<verse eid="MIC 6:9"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:10"/>Will a fire and a lawless person's house [treasuring up] lawless treasure and a measure of pride-- injustice?<verse eid="MIC 6:10"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:11"/>Shall the lawless be justified by a pair of scales, or deceitful weights by a bag?<verse eid="MIC 6:11"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:12"/>From these they filled their wealth with impiety. And her inhabitants were speaking lies, and their tongue was exalted in their mouth.<verse eid="MIC 6:12"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:13"/>And I will begin to strike you down; I will annihilate you because of your sins.<verse eid="MIC 6:13"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:14"/>You shall eat, and you shall not be satisfied. And it shall grow dark within you, and you shall swim away and shall not escape. And as many as shall escape shall be delivered over to the sword.<verse eid="MIC 6:14"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:15"/>You shall sow, and you shall not reap; you shall press the olive and shall not anoint yourself with oil, and even wine you shall not drink, and the precepts of my people shall be annihilated,<verse eid="MIC 6:15"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 6:16"/>and all the works of the house of Achaab. And you walked in their counsels, that I might give you over to annihilation and her inhabitants to hissing, and you shall receive reproaches of peoples.<verse eid="MIC 6:16"/>



  <chapter sid="MIC 7"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:1"/>Woe is me, because I have become like one gathering stubble at the harvest and like grape gleanings at the vintage, when there is no cluster to eat the firstlings. Woe is me, O soul,<verse eid="MIC 7:1"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:2"/>because the devout has perished from the land, and there is none among people who is upright; all give a judgment for<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">7:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'aiming at'</char></note> blood; they afflict, each his neighbor, with affliction.<verse eid="MIC 7:2"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:3"/>They prepare their hands for evil; the ruler requests, and the judge has spoken peaceful words; it is what pleases his soul. And I will take away their good things<verse eid="MIC 7:3"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:4"/>like a moth eating and crawling on a rod in the day of your watching.[Woe, woe,] your vengeance has come; now their weeping shall come.<verse eid="MIC 7:4"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:5"/>Put no trust in friends, and do not hope in leaders; guard yourself against your bedmate, so as to communicate anything to her;<verse eid="MIC 7:5"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:6"/>for a son dishonors a father, a daughter shall rise up against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; the enemies of a man are the men in his house.<verse eid="MIC 7:6"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:7"/>But as for me, I will look to the Lord; I will wait for God my savior; my God will hear me.<verse eid="MIC 7:7"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:8"/>Stop rejoicing over me, O my lady adversary, because I have fallen and I shall rise, for though I shall sit in darkness, the Lord shall give me light.<verse eid="MIC 7:8"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:9"/>I will endure the wrath of the Lord -- because I sinned against him-- until he justifies my sentence, and he will accomplish my judgment and will bring me out into the light; I will see his justice.<verse eid="MIC 7:9"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:10"/>And my lady adversary will see and will be covered with shame, she who says to me, "Where is the Lord your God?" My eyes shall look upon her; now she shall become an object to be trampled like clay in the streets<verse eid="MIC 7:10"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:11"/>during a day of daubing of brick. That day will be your erasure, and that day will rub out your precepts.<verse eid="MIC 7:11"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:12"/>And your cities shall come to a leveling and a dividing [of the Assyrians], and your strong cities to a dividing from Tyre as far as a river-- a day of water and confusion.<verse eid="MIC 7:12"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:13"/>The earth will become an annihilation with its inhabitants, for the fruits of their doings.<verse eid="MIC 7:13"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:14"/>Shepherd your people with your rod, the sheep of your possession, tenting alone in a forest in the midst of Carmel; they shall feed in Basanitis and Galaaditis as the days of old.<verse eid="MIC 7:14"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:15"/>And as in the days of your exit from Egypt, you shall see marvelous things.<verse eid="MIC 7:15"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:16"/>Nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hands on their mouth; their ears shall be deafened;<verse eid="MIC 7:16"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:17"/>they shall lick dust like a snake, as they trail dirt; they shall be confounded in their enclosure; they shall be amazed at the Lord, your God, and shall be afraid of you.<verse eid="MIC 7:17"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:18"/>Who is god like you, removing injustices and passing over impieties for the remnant of his possession? And he did not retain his anger for a witness, because he is one that desires mercy.<verse eid="MIC 7:18"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:19"/>He will turn and have compassion upon us; he will sink our injustices and cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.<verse eid="MIC 7:19"/>
    <verse sid="MIC 7:20"/>You will give truth to Iakob, mercy to Abraam, as you swore to our fathers in former days.<verse eid="MIC 7:20"/>
