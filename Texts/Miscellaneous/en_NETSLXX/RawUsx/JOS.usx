  <chapter sid="JOS 1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:1"/>And it happened after the death of Moyses that the Lord spoke to Iesous son of Naue, Moyses' assistant, saying,<verse eid="JOS 1:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:2"/>"Moyses my attendant is dead. Now then rise up to cross the Jordan, you and all this people, into the land that I am giving to them.<verse eid="JOS 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:3"/>Every place upon which you tread with the sole of your feet, to you I will give it, as I promised to Moyses,<verse eid="JOS 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:4"/>the wilderness and Anti-Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates, and as far as the farthest sea; from the setting of the sun shall be your boundaries.<verse eid="JOS 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:5"/>No person shall stand against you<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:5</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Greek = plural</char></note> all the days of your<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:5</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Greek = singular</char></note> life. And just as I was with Moyses, so I will also be with you, and I will not forsake you or overlook you.<verse eid="JOS 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:6"/>Be strong and manly, for you shall divide for this people the land that I swore to your ancestors to give to them.<verse eid="JOS 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:7"/>Be strong, therefore, and manly, to observe and act as Moyses my servant commanded you, and you shall not turn aside from them to the right or to the left so that you may be perceptive in everything you do.<verse eid="JOS 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:8"/>And the book of this law shall not depart out of your mouth, and you shall meditate on it day and night so that you may understand how to do all that is written. Then you shall prosper and make your ways prosperous, and then you shall be perceptive.<verse eid="JOS 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:9"/>Look, I have commanded you: Be strong and manly; do not be cowardly or frightened, for the Lord your God is with you in all places where you go."<verse eid="JOS 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:10"/>And Iesous commanded the scribes of the people, saying,<verse eid="JOS 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:11"/>"Go into the midst of the camp of the people, and command the people, saying: 'Prepare provisions, for yet three days and you are crossing over this Jordan, when you go in to take possession of the land that the Lord, God of your ancestors, gives you.'"<verse eid="JOS 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:12"/>And to Rouben and to Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasse Iesous said,<verse eid="JOS 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:13"/>"Remember the word of the Lord that Moyses the servant of the Lord commanded you, saying, 'The Lord your God has given you rest and has given you this land.'<verse eid="JOS 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:14"/>Let your wives and your little ones and your livestock settle in the land he gave you. But you shall cross over well-equipped before your kindred, every strong man, and you shall fight on their side<verse eid="JOS 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:15"/>until the Lord your God gives rest to your kindred, as also to you, and they too inherit the land that the Lord your God is giving them. And each of you shall depart to his inheritance, which Moyses gave to you beyond the Jordan, from the rising of the sun."<verse eid="JOS 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:16"/>And in reply to Iesous, they said: "All that you have commanded us we will do, and to every place you send us we will go.<verse eid="JOS 1:16"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:17"/>Just as we obeyed Moyses in all things, we will obey you. Only let the Lord our God be with you, as he was with Moyses.<verse eid="JOS 1:17"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 1:18"/>But the person who is disobedient towards you and whoever disobeys your words, as you command him, let him die. But be strong and manly."<verse eid="JOS 1:18"/>



  <chapter sid="JOS 2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:1"/>And Iesous son of Naue sent two young men from Sattin to spy, saying, "Go up, and view the land, especially Iericho." And the two young men went and entered Iericho, and they entered the house of a prostitute whose name was Raab and lodged there.<verse eid="JOS 2:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:2"/>And it was reported to the king of Iericho, saying, "Men of the sons of Israel have come here to spy out the land."<verse eid="JOS 2:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:3"/>And the king of Iericho sent and spoke to Raab, saying, "Bring out the men who entered your house tonight, for they have come to spy out the land."<verse eid="JOS 2:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:4"/>And the woman took the men and hid them, and she said to them, saying, "The men came to me.<verse eid="JOS 2:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:5"/>But when the gate was closed at dark, then the men went out. Where they went I do not know. Pursue after them, if you can overtake them."<verse eid="JOS 2:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:6"/>She had, however, brought them up upon the roof and hid them in the flax-straw that she had laid out upon the roof.<verse eid="JOS 2:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:7"/>And the men pursued after them on the way by the Jordan to the fords, and the gate was closed. And it happened, when those who were pursuing after them had gone out<verse eid="JOS 2:7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:8"/>and before they too went to sleep, she too came up on the roof to them<verse eid="JOS 2:8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:9"/>and said to them, "I know that the Lord has given you the land, for the dread of you has fallen on us.<verse eid="JOS 2:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:10"/>For we have heard that the Lord God dried up the Red Sea before you when you came out of the land of Egypt and what he did to the two kings of the Amorrites that were beyond the Jordan, to Seon and Og, those whom you utterly destroyed.<verse eid="JOS 2:10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:11"/>And when we heard it, we were distraught in our heart, and there was no spirit left in any of us from before you, for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on earth below.<verse eid="JOS 2:11"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:12"/>And now, since I am showing you pity, swear to me by the Lord God that you also in turn will show pity in the house of my father<verse eid="JOS 2:12"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:13"/>and spare the house of my father and my mother and my brothers and all my house and all that belong to them and deliver my soul from death."<verse eid="JOS 2:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:14"/>And the men said to her, "Our soul for yours unto death." And she said, "When the Lord hands over to you the city, you shall show me pity and truth."<verse eid="JOS 2:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:15"/>And she let them down through the window.<verse eid="JOS 2:15"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:16"/>And she said to them, "Depart into the hill country so that the pursuers may not come upon you. And you shall be hidden there three days until those who pursue after you have returned, and afterward you shall depart on your way."<verse eid="JOS 2:16"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:17"/>And the men said to her, "We are free from this oath of yours.<verse eid="JOS 2:17"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:18"/>Look, we are entering a part of the city, and you shall set in place the sign. You shall tie this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down, and you shall gather to yourself, into your house, your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father's family.<verse eid="JOS 2:18"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:19"/>And it shall be that everyone who goes out of the door of your house into the street, he shall be liable on his own account, and we will be free from this oath of yours. And any who are with you in your house, we shall be liable.<verse eid="JOS 2:19"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:20"/>But if anyone wrongs us or also discloses this business of ours, we shall be free from this oath of yours."<verse eid="JOS 2:20"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:21"/>And she said to them, "According to your word, so let it be." And she sent them away.<verse eid="JOS 2:21"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:22"/>And they departed and went into the hill country and stayed there three days. And the pursuers searched all the roads and did not find them.<verse eid="JOS 2:22"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:23"/>And the two young men returned and came down from the mountain. And they crossed over to Iesous son of Naue and told him all that had happened to them.<verse eid="JOS 2:23"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 2:24"/>And they said to Iesous, "The Lord has given all the land into our hand, and everyone who inhabits that land cowers because of us."<verse eid="JOS 2:24"/>



  <chapter sid="JOS 3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:1"/>And Iesous rose early in the morning and departed out of Sattin, and they came as far as the Jordan and lodged there before crossing over.<verse eid="JOS 3:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:2"/>And it happened after three days that the scribes went through the camp<verse eid="JOS 3:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:3"/>and commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord our God and our priests and the Leuites carrying it, you shall depart from your places. And go after it.<verse eid="JOS 3:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:4"/>But let there be a distance between you and it, as much as two thousand cubits. You shall stand still. Do not approach it so that you may know the way whereby you will go, for you have not gone the way from yesterday and the third day."<verse eid="JOS 3:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:5"/>And Iesous said to the people, "Purify yourselves for tomorrow; for tomorrow among you the Lord will do wonders."<verse eid="JOS 3:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:6"/>And Iesous said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and go before the people." And the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord and went in front of the people.<verse eid="JOS 3:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:7"/>And the Lord said to Iesous, "On this day I am beginning to exalt you before all the sons of Israel so that they may know that as I was with Moyses, so will I be also with you.<verse eid="JOS 3:7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:8"/>And now command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, 'When you enter upon a part of the water of the Jordan, then you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"<verse eid="JOS 3:8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:9"/>And Iesous said to the sons of Israel, "Draw near here, and hear the word of the Lord your God.<verse eid="JOS 3:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:10"/>By this you shall know that a living god is among you, and with destruction he will destroy from before us the Chananite and the Chettite and the Pherezite and the Heuite and the Amorrite and the Gergesite and the Iebousite:<verse eid="JOS 3:10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:11"/>Look, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes through the Jordan.<verse eid="JOS 3:11"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:12"/>Select for yourselves twelve men from the sons of Israel, one from each tribe.<verse eid="JOS 3:12"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:13"/>And it will be, when the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth rest in the water of the Jordan, that the water of the Jordan shall cease, and the water coming down shall stand still."<verse eid="JOS 3:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:14"/>And the people departed from their coverts to cross over the Jordan, and the priests bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord in front of the people.<verse eid="JOS 3:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:15"/>Now when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant were entering the Jordan and the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were dipped in part of the water of the Jordan-- now the Jordan would overflow throughout all its channel-system as if it were the days of wheat harvest--<verse eid="JOS 3:15"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:16"/>and the waters flowing down from above stood still, a single solid heap stood apart very, very far off, as far as part of Kariathiarim, and that which came down came down to the sea of Araba, the salt sea, until it completely ceased. And the people stood opposite Iericho.<verse eid="JOS 3:16"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 3:17"/>And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan-- and all the sons of Israel were crossing over on dry land-- until all the people finished crossing over the Jordan.<verse eid="JOS 3:17"/>



  <chapter sid="JOS 4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:1"/>And when all the people finished crossing over the Jordan, then the Lord said to Iesous, saying,<verse eid="JOS 4:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:2"/>"Take along men from the people, one from each tribe;<verse eid="JOS 4:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:3"/>instruct them, saying, 'Take twelve stones at hand out of the middle of the Jordan, and when you have carried these over with you, lay them down in your camp, there where you make camp for the night.'"<verse eid="JOS 4:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:4"/>And when Iesous had summoned twelve men of the honored from the sons of Israel, one from each tribe,<verse eid="JOS 4:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:5"/>he said to them, "Pass on before me, before the Lord, into the middle of the Jordan, and when each has taken up a stone from there, let him carry it on his shoulders, according to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel,<verse eid="JOS 4:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:6"/>so that these may exist as a sign for you, in place for all time; so that when your son asks you tomorrow, saying, 'What are these stones to you?'<verse eid="JOS 4:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:7"/>then you shall explain to your son, saying, 'Because the river Jordan failed from before the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth, when it crossed over it. And these stones shall be to you a memorial, to the sons of Israel forever.'"<verse eid="JOS 4:7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:8"/>And the sons of Israel did so, as the Lord commanded Iesous. And they took up twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as the Lord instructed Iesous at the completion of the crossing over of the sons of Israel, and they carried them over with them to the camp and laid them down there.<verse eid="JOS 4:8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:9"/>Now Iesous also set up another twelve stones in the Jordan itself, in the place that was under the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and they are there until this very day.<verse eid="JOS 4:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:10"/>Now the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood in the Jordan until Iesous finished everything the Lord commanded him to tell the people. And the people hastened, and they crossed over.<verse eid="JOS 4:10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:11"/>And it happened, as soon as all the people had finished crossing over, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord passed over, and the stones in front of them.<verse eid="JOS 4:11"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:12"/>And the sons of Rouben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasse crossed over equipped before the sons of Israel, as Moyses had commanded them.<verse eid="JOS 4:12"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:13"/>Forty thousand well girded for battle passed over before the Lord for war against the city of Iericho.<verse eid="JOS 4:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:14"/>On that day the Lord exalted Iesous before the whole race of Israel, and they feared him, as they had Moyses, for as long a time as he lived.<verse eid="JOS 4:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:15"/>And the Lord said to Iesous, saying,<verse eid="JOS 4:15"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:16"/>"Command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant of the testimony of the Lord to come up out of the Jordan."<verse eid="JOS 4:16"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:17"/>And Iesous commanded the priests, saying, "Come up out of the Jordan."<verse eid="JOS 4:17"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:18"/>And it happened, as soon as the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord came up out of the Jordan and set their feet on the land, that the water of the Jordan rushed headlong into place and went as yesterday and the third day throughout all its banks.<verse eid="JOS 4:18"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:19"/>And the people went up out of the Jordan on the tenth of the first month, and the sons of Israel encamped in Galgala in the part toward sunrise, from Iericho.<verse eid="JOS 4:19"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:20"/>And those twelve stones, which he had taken out of the Jordan, Iesous set up in Galgala,<verse eid="JOS 4:20"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:21"/>saying, "When your sons ask you, saying, 'What are these stones?'<verse eid="JOS 4:21"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:22"/>proclaim to your sons, 'Israel crossed over the Jordan on dry ground,<verse eid="JOS 4:22"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:23"/>when the Lord our God dried up the water of the Jordan from before them until they crossed over, as the Lord our God did to the Red Sea, which the Lord our God dried up before us until we passed by,<verse eid="JOS 4:23"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 4:24"/>so that all the nations of the earth may know that the power of the Lord is mighty and in order that you may worship the Lord your God for all time.'"<verse eid="JOS 4:24"/>



  <chapter sid="JOS 5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:1"/>And it happened, when the kings of the Amorrites, who were beyond the Jordan, and the kings of Phoenicia by the sea heard that the Lord God had dried up the Jordan river from before the sons of Israel when they crossed over, that their hearts melted, and they were panic-stricken, and there was no understanding in them, from before the sons of Israel.<verse eid="JOS 5:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:2"/>Now about that time, the Lord said to Iesous, "Make for yourself flint knives out of sharp rock, and sit down, and circumcise the sons of Israel."<verse eid="JOS 5:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:3"/>And Iesous made sharp flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at the place called Hill of Foreskins.<verse eid="JOS 5:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:4"/>And how Iesous completely purified the sons of Israel-- as many as were born on the way and as many as were uncircumcised of those who had come out of Egypt--<verse eid="JOS 5:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:5"/>all these Iesous circumcised.<verse eid="JOS 5:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:6"/>For Israel had gone about in the wilderness of Madbaritis for forty-two years, wherefore most of their warriors who had come out of the land of Egypt were uncircumcised, those who disobeyed God's ordinances, concerning whom he also determined that they would not see the land that the Lord had sworn to their forefathers to give to us, a land flowing with milk and honey.<verse eid="JOS 5:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:7"/>And in their place he raised up their sons, whom Iesous circumcised because they remained uncircumcised on the way.<verse eid="JOS 5:7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:8"/>Now when they had been circumcised, they kept quiet there, remaining in the camp until they were healed.<verse eid="JOS 5:8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:9"/>And the Lord said to Iesous son of Naue, "On this very day I have taken away the reproach of Egypt from you." And he called the name of that place Galgala.<verse eid="JOS 5:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:10"/>And the sons of Israel kept the pascha on the fourteenth day of the month from evening at sunset at Iericho on the opposite side of the Jordan in the plain.<verse eid="JOS 5:10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:11"/>And they ate from the grain of the land, things unleavened and fresh. On this day<verse eid="JOS 5:11"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:12"/>the manna ceased, after they had eaten from the grain of the land, and the sons of Israel no longer had manna, and they enjoyed the fruit of the country of the Phoenicians in that year.<verse eid="JOS 5:12"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:13"/>And it happened, when Iesous was at Iericho, that he looked up with his eyes and saw a person standing before him, and his sword was drawn in his hand. And Iesous approached and said to him, "Are you one of us or on the side of our adversaries?"<verse eid="JOS 5:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:14"/>Then he said to him, "As commander-in-chief of the force of the Lord I have now come." And Iesous fell facedown onto the earth, and he said to him, "Master, what do you order your domestic?"<verse eid="JOS 5:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 5:15"/>And the commander-in-chief of the Lord said to Iesous, "Loosen the sandal from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy."<verse eid="JOS 5:15"/>



  <chapter sid="JOS 6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:1"/>And Iericho was completely closed up and fortified, and no one came out from it nor went in.<verse eid="JOS 6:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:2"/>And the Lord said to Iesous, "Look, I am delivering Iericho into your control, and its king in it, mighty ones in strength.<verse eid="JOS 6:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:3"/>And you, station around it the warriors in a circle.<verse eid="JOS 6:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:4"/><verse eid="JOS 6:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:5"/>And it shall be as soon as you sound with the trumpet, let all the people shout together. And when they shout, the walls of the city will fall spontaneously, and all the people shall enter, each one rushing headlong into the city."<verse eid="JOS 6:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:6"/>And Iesous the son of Naue went in to the priests<verse eid="JOS 6:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:7"/>and spoke to them, saying, "Charge the people to go around and surround the city. And let the warriors pass by in arms before the Lord.<verse eid="JOS 6:7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:8"/>"And let seven priests holding seven sacred trumpets proceed in this manner before the Lord, and let them signal vigorously. And let the ark of the covenant of the Lord follow.<verse eid="JOS 6:8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:9"/>And let the warriors go before, and the priests who bring up the rear, behind the ark of the covenant of the Lord, as they walk and trumpet."<verse eid="JOS 6:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:10"/>And the people Iesous commanded, saying, "Do not shout, and do not let anyone hear your voice until the day he himself tells you to shout, and then you shall shout."<verse eid="JOS 6:10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:11"/>And when the ark of the covenant of God had gone around the city, it immediately went back into the camp and lodged there.<verse eid="JOS 6:11"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:12"/>And on the second day Iesous rose in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord.<verse eid="JOS 6:12"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:13"/>And the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets passed on before the Lord, and afterwards the warriors entered, and the rest of the crowd behind the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the priests sounded with the trumpets. And all the rest of the crowd encircled the city from close at hand<verse eid="JOS 6:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:14"/>and went back again into the camp. Thus they kept doing for six days.<verse eid="JOS 6:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:15"/>And on the seventh day they rose at dawn and marched around the city seven times.<verse eid="JOS 6:15"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:16"/>And on the seventh circuit the priests trumpeted, and Iesous said to the sons of Israel, "Cry out, for the Lord has given you the city.<verse eid="JOS 6:16"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:17"/>And the city shall be devoted, it and all that is in it, to the Lord Sabaoth. Only keep safe Raab the prostitute, her and what is in her house.<verse eid="JOS 6:17"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:18"/>But you, keep well away from what is devoted so that you yourselves do not covet and take any of what is devoted and make the camp of the sons of Israel a devoted thing and annihilate us.<verse eid="JOS 6:18"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:19"/>And all silver or gold or bronze or iron shall be sacred to the Lord; it shall be carried into the treasury of the Lord."<verse eid="JOS 6:19"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:20"/>And the priests sounded with the trumpets. And as soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpets, all the people at the same time raised a great and strong shout, and the whole wall fell down all around. And all the people went up into the city.<verse eid="JOS 6:20"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:21"/>And with the edge of the sword Iesous devoted it and all that was in the city, from man even to woman, from young man even to old, and even to calf and draft animal.<verse eid="JOS 6:21"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:22"/>And Iesous said to the two young men who had served as spies, "Go into the woman's house, and bring her out from there and all that is hers."<verse eid="JOS 6:22"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:23"/>And the two young men who had spied out the city went into the house of the woman and brought out Raab the prostitute and her father and her mother and her brothers and all that was hers and her kindred. And they set her outside the camp of Israel.<verse eid="JOS 6:23"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:24"/>And the city was burned with burning with all that was in it. Only things of silver and gold and bronze and iron did they give, to be brought into the treasury of the Lord.<verse eid="JOS 6:24"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:25"/>And Raab the prostitute and all her father's house Iesous kept alive, and it has dwelled in Israel until this very day. For she hid the spies whom Iesous sent to spy out Iericho.<verse eid="JOS 6:25"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:26"/>And Iesous swore on that day before the Lord, saying, "Cursed be the person who shall build that city. At the cost of his firstborn he shall found it, and at the cost of his youngest he shall set up its gates." And thus did Ozan of Baithel; at the cost of Abiron, his firstborn, he founded it, and at the cost of his youngest, although he escaped, he set up its gates.<verse eid="JOS 6:26"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 6:27"/>And the Lord was with Iesous, and his name was in all the land.<verse eid="JOS 6:27"/>



  <chapter sid="JOS 7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:1"/>And the sons of Israel committed a major offense and appropriated for themselves part of what was devoted. And Achar son of Charmi son of Zambri son of Zara, of the tribe of Ioudas, took from what was devoted, and the Lord was furiously angry with the sons of Israel.<verse eid="JOS 7:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:2"/>And Iesous sent men to Gai, which is near Baithel, saying, "Spy out Gai." And the men went up and spied out Gai.<verse eid="JOS 7:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:3"/>And they returned to Iesous and said to him, "Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and take the city by siege. Do not lead up there the whole people, for they are few."<verse eid="JOS 7:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:4"/>And about three thousand men went up, and they fled before the men of Gai.<verse eid="JOS 7:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:5"/>And of them the men of Gai killed up to thirty-six men. And they pursued them from the gate, and they crushed them on the slope. And the heart of the people was terrified and became like water.<verse eid="JOS 7:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:6"/>And Iesous tore his clothes, and Iesous fell on the ground facedown before the Lord until evening, he and the elders of Israel, and they threw dust on their heads.<verse eid="JOS 7:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:7"/>And Iesous said, "I pray, Lord, why has your servant brought this people across the Jordan, to hand them over to the Amorrite so as to destroy us? If only we had remained and been settled beyond the Jordan.<verse eid="JOS 7:7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:8"/>And what shall I say, since Israel has turned its neck before its enemy?<verse eid="JOS 7:8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:9"/>And when the Chananite and all the inhabitants of the land hear, they will surround us and wipe us out from the land. And what will you make of your great name?"<verse eid="JOS 7:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:10"/>And the Lord said to Iesous, "Stand up. Why is it that you have fallen upon your face?<verse eid="JOS 7:10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:11"/>The people have sinned and transgressed the covenant that I made with them. And they have stolen from what is devoted and put it into their own belongings.<verse eid="JOS 7:11"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:12"/>The sons of Israel shall not be able to stand before their enemies; they shall turn their neck before their enemies, because they have become what is devoted. I will be with you no longer, unless you remove what is devoted from yourselves.<verse eid="JOS 7:12"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:13"/>Stand up, sanctify the people, and tell them to be sanctified for tomorrow. This is what the Lord God of Israel says, 'What is devoted is among you. You will be unable to withstand before your enemies until you remove what is devoted from among you.'<verse eid="JOS 7:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:14"/>And all of you shall be gathered together in the morning by tribes. And it shall be that the tribe that the Lord shows-- you shall bring it near by districts. And the district that the Lord shows you shall bring near by household. And the household that the Lord shows you shall bring near by man.<verse eid="JOS 7:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:15"/>And the one who is indicated shall be burned with fire, and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the Lord and has committed lawlessness in Israel."<verse eid="JOS 7:15"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:16"/>And Iesous rose early and brought the people near by tribes, and the tribe of Ioudas was shown.<verse eid="JOS 7:16"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:17"/>And it was brought near by districts, and the Zarai district was shown. And it was brought near by man,<verse eid="JOS 7:17"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:18"/>and Achar son of Zambri son of Zara was shown.<verse eid="JOS 7:18"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:19"/>And Iesous said to Achar, "Give glory today to the Lord, God of Israel, and make the confession. And tell me what you have done, and do not hide it from me."<verse eid="JOS 7:19"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:20"/>And Achar answered Iesous and said, "Truly I have sinned against the Lord, God of Israel. Thus and so have I done.<verse eid="JOS 7:20"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:21"/>I saw in the spoil a beautiful, many-colored carpet and two hundred didrachmas of silver and one golden tongue-shaped object of fifty didrachmas, and I coveted them and took them. And look, they are hidden in the ground in my tent, and the silver is hidden underneath them."<verse eid="JOS 7:21"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:22"/>And Iesous sent messengers, and they ran to the tent into the camp, and these things were hidden in the tent, and the silver was underneath them.<verse eid="JOS 7:22"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:23"/>And they brought them out of the tent and brought them to Iesous and the elders of Israel, and they set them before the Lord.<verse eid="JOS 7:23"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 7:24"/>And Iesous took Achar son of Zara and brought him up to the ravine of Achor, and his sons and his daughters and his bull calves and his draft animals and all his sheep and his tent and all his belongings-- and all the people with him.

    <verse sid="JOS 7:26"/>And they set up over him a great heap of stones. And the Lord ceased from burning anger.

  <chapter sid="JOS 8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:1"/>And the Lord said to Iesous, "Do not fear, nor be afraid. Take with you the men, all the military men, and get up, go up to Gai. See, I have given into your hands the king of Gai and his land.<verse eid="JOS 8:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:2"/>And you shall do to Gai as you did to Iericho and its king. And the spoil of the cattle you shall carry away as spoil for yourself. Now set for yourself an ambush against the city, behind."<verse eid="JOS 8:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:3"/>And Iesous and all the military people got up to go up against Gai. And Iesous picked out thirty thousand men mighty in strength and sent them off by night.<verse eid="JOS 8:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:4"/>And he commanded them, saying, "You, lie in ambush behind the city; do not be far from the city, and all of you shall be ready.<verse eid="JOS 8:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:5"/>And I and all those with me will approach the city. And it shall be that when the inhabitants of Gai come out against us, as also before, then we shall flee from before them.<verse eid="JOS 8:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:6"/>And when they come out after us, we will draw them away from the city. And they will say, 'They are fleeing from before us, as also previously.'<verse eid="JOS 8:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:7"/>And you shall rise up out of the ambush and go into the city.<verse eid="JOS 8:7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:8"/>And you shall act according to this word; see, I have commanded you."<verse eid="JOS 8:8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:9"/>And Iesous sent them off, and they went to the ambush, and lay between Baithel and between Gai, from the sea of Gai.<verse eid="JOS 8:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:10"/>And Iesous early in the morning mustered the people, and they went up, he and the elders, before the people to Gai.<verse eid="JOS 8:10"/>

    <verse sid="JOS 8:13"/><verse eid="JOS 8:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:14"/>And it happened, when the king of Gai saw this, that he hurried and went out to meet them directly in battle, he and all the people who were with him, and he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.<verse eid="JOS 8:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:15"/>And Iesous and Israel saw it and retreated from before them.<verse eid="JOS 8:15"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:16"/>And they closely pursued after the sons of Israel, and they themselves went away from the city.<verse eid="JOS 8:16"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:17"/>There was no one left in Gai who did not closely pursue after Israel, and they left the city open and closely pursued after Israel.<verse eid="JOS 8:17"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:18"/>And the Lord said to Iesous, "Stretch out your hand with the javelin that is in your hand toward the city, for I have given it into your hands.

    <verse sid="JOS 8:19"/>And the ambush rose up quickly out of its place, and they came out when he stretched out his hand. And they went to the city and took it, and they hurried and set the city on fire with fire.<verse eid="JOS 8:19"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:20"/>And when the inhabitants of Gai looked around behind them, then they beheld smoke rising up out of the city to the sky. And they no longer had anywhere to flee this way or that way.<verse eid="JOS 8:20"/>

    <verse sid="JOS 8:23"/>And they took the king of Gai alive and brought him to Iesous.<verse eid="JOS 8:23"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:24"/>And when the sons of Israel had finished slaying all those in Gai, those in the plains and on the mountain on the descent, there where they fully pursued them, then Iesous turned back to Gai and struck it with the edge of the sword.<verse eid="JOS 8:24"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 8:25"/>And those who fell that day, from man even to woman, were twelve thousand-- all the inhabitants of Gai.<verse eid="JOS 8:25"/>

  <chapter sid="JOS 9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:1"/>Now when the kings of the Amorrites, who were on the other side of the Jordan, who were in the hill country and who were in the plain and who were in all the coast of the great sea, and who were near Anti-Lebanon, and the Chettites and the Chananites and the Pherezites and the Heuites and the Amorrites and the Gergesites and the Iebousites heard,<verse eid="JOS 9:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:2"/>they gathered together, all of them with one accord, to make war against Iesous and Israel.<verse eid="JOS 9:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:2a"/>Then Iesous built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Gaibal,<verse eid="JOS 9:2a"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:2b"/>as Moyses the attendant of the Lord had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the law of Moyses, "an altar of whole stones on which iron was not applied," and he brought up there whole burnt offerings to the Lord and an offering of deliverance.<verse eid="JOS 9:2b"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:2c"/>And Iesous wrote on the stones Deuteronomion<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">9:2</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'Deuteronomy'</char></note>, a law of Moyses, which he wrote in the presence of the sons of Israel.<verse eid="JOS 9:2c"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:2d"/>And all Israel and their elders and their judges and their scribes passed on one side and on the other side of the ark, opposite, and the priests and the Leuites took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the guest and the native-born. Half of them were near Mount Garizin and half of them were near Mount Gaibal, as Moyses the attendant of the Lord commanded at first, to bless the people.<verse eid="JOS 9:2d"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:2e"/>And after these things Iesous thus read all the words of this law, the blessings and the curses, according to all things written in the law of Moyses.<verse eid="JOS 9:2e"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:2f"/>There was not a word of all that Moyses commanded Iesous that Iesous did not read in the ears of all the assembly of the sons of Israel, to the men and the women and the children and the guests who attached themselves to Israel.<verse eid="JOS 9:2f"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:3"/>And the inhabitants of Gabaon heard all that the Lord did to Iericho and to Gai.<verse eid="JOS 9:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:4"/>And indeed they on their part acted with cunning, and they went, prepared provisions and got themselves ready. And they put old sacks on their donkeys and old and torn, bound-up wineskins.<verse eid="JOS 9:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:5"/>And the hollows of their shoes and their sandals were old and clouted on their feet, and their garments were worn out upon them, and the bread of their provision was dry and moldy and bug-infested.<verse eid="JOS 9:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:6"/>And they came to Iesous into the camp of Israel to Galgala, and they said to Iesous and Israel, "We have come from a land far away; now then make a covenant with us."<verse eid="JOS 9:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:7"/>And the sons of Israel said to the Chorrite, "Take heed, lest you live with me, and how am I to make a covenant with you?"<verse eid="JOS 9:7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:8"/>And they said to Iesous, "We are your domestics." And Iesous said to them, "From where are you? And from where have you come?"<verse eid="JOS 9:8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:9"/>And they said, "Your servants have come from a land very far away in the name of the Lord your God; for we have heard his name and what he did in Egypt<verse eid="JOS 9:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:10"/>and what he did to the kings of the Amorrites who were on the other side of the Jordan, to Seon, king of Hesebon, and to Og, king of Basan, who lived in Astaroth and in Edrain.<verse eid="JOS 9:10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:11"/>And when they heard, our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spoke to us, saying, 'Take provision for yourselves for the journey, and go to meet them, and you shall say to them, "We are your domestics; now then make a covenant with us.'"<verse eid="JOS 9:11"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:12"/>These are the loaves; we took them for our journey when they were hot on the day on which we set out to come to you, but now they are dried and have become bug-infested.<verse eid="JOS 9:12"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:13"/>And these are the skins of wine that we filled when they were new, and they are burst. And our garments and our shoes are worn out because of the very long journey."<verse eid="JOS 9:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:14"/>And the leaders took of their provision and did not ask the Lord.<verse eid="JOS 9:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:15"/>And Iesous made peace with them, and they made a covenant with them, to preserve them, and the leaders of the congregation swore an oath to them.<verse eid="JOS 9:15"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:16"/>And it happened three days after they had made a covenant with them that they heard that they were close by them and that they were living among them.<verse eid="JOS 9:16"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:17"/>And the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities. And their cities were Gabaon and Kephira and Berot and Iarin-City.<verse eid="JOS 9:17"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:18"/>But the sons of Israel did not fight against them, because all the leaders had sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the leaders.<verse eid="JOS 9:18"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:19"/>And the leaders said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by the Lord, the God of Israel, and now we shall not be able to touch them.<verse eid="JOS 9:19"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:20"/>This we will do: take them alive, and we will preserve them. And there shall not be wrath against us because of the oath that we swore to them.<verse eid="JOS 9:20"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:21"/>They shall live and shall be hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation"-- as the leaders said to them.<verse eid="JOS 9:21"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:22"/>And Iesous called them together and said to them, "Why have you misled me, saying, 'We live very far from you,' but you are fellow dwellers, those who live among us?<verse eid="JOS 9:22"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:23"/>And now you are cursed; there shall not be lacking from you a slave or a hewer of wood for me and my God."<verse eid="JOS 9:23"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:24"/>And they answered Iesous, saying, "It was reported to us what the Lord your God instructed his servant Moyses, to give you this land and to destroy us and all its inhabitants from before you, and we greatly feared for our lives before you and did this thing.<verse eid="JOS 9:24"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:25"/>And now, see, we are in your power; do to us as it is pleasing to you and as it seems right to you."<verse eid="JOS 9:25"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:26"/>And thus they did to them, and Iesous rescued them on that day out of the hands of the sons of Israel, and they did not kill them.<verse eid="JOS 9:26"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 9:27"/>And Iesous made them on that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the whole congregation and for the altar of God. Therefore the inhabitants of Gabaon became hewers of wood and drawers of water of the altar of God until this very day, and in the place that the Lord should choose.<verse eid="JOS 9:27"/>



  <chapter sid="JOS 10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:1"/>And when Adonibezek, king of Ierousalem, heard that Iesous had taken Gai and had utterly destroyed it-- as they did to Iericho and its king, so they did to Gai and its king-- and that the inhabitants of Gabaon had deserted to Iesous and to Israel,<verse eid="JOS 10:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:2"/>then they became greatly frightened by means of them, for he knew that Gabaon was a large city, like one of the mother-cities, and all its men were strong.<verse eid="JOS 10:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:3"/>And Adonibezek, king of Ierousalem, sent to Ailam, king of Chebron, and to Phidon, king of Ierimouth, and to Iephtha, king of Lachis, and to Dabir, king of Odollam, saying,<verse eid="JOS 10:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:4"/>"Come up here to me, and help me, and let us go to war with Gabaon, for they have deserted to Iesous and to the sons of Israel."<verse eid="JOS 10:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:5"/>And the five kings of the Iebousites-- the king of Ierousalem and the king of Chebron and the king of Ierimouth and the king of Lachis and the king of Odollam-- went up, they and all their people, and surrounded Gabaon and besieged it.<verse eid="JOS 10:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:6"/>And the inhabitants of Gabaon sent to Iesous into the camp of Israel to Galgala, saying, "Do not relax your hands from your servants. Come up to us quickly, and rescue us, and help us, for all the kings of the Amorrites who live in the hill country are gathered together against us."<verse eid="JOS 10:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:7"/>And Iesous went up out of Galgala, he and all the military people with him, every one mighty in strength.<verse eid="JOS 10:7"/>

    <verse sid="JOS 10:9"/>And Iesous came upon them suddenly; he entered all night out of Galgala.<verse eid="JOS 10:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:10"/>And the Lord confounded them before the sons of Israel, and the Lord shattered them with great destruction at Gabaon, and they pursued them by the way of the ascent of Horonin and cut them down as far as Azeka and as far as Make-da.<verse eid="JOS 10:10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:11"/>Now as they fled from before the sons of Israel, upon the descent of Horonin, then the Lord threw down upon them hailstones from heaven as far as Azeka, and there were more who died through the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed by dagger in the battle.<verse eid="JOS 10:11"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:12"/>Then Iesous spoke to the Lord, on the day when God delivered the Amorrite into the control of Israel, when he shattered them at Gabaon, and they were shattered before the sons of Israel, and Iesous said, "Let the sun stand at Gabaon, and the moon at the ravine of Ailon."<verse eid="JOS 10:12"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:13"/>And the sun stood still, and the moon was in position until God avenged himself on their enemies, and the sun stood in midheaven; it did not go forward to set until the end of<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">10:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'until the end of':  Or 'completely within'</char></note> one day.<verse eid="JOS 10:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:14"/>And there was not such a day either before or after so that a god heeded a human being, because the Lord fought alongside Israel.<verse eid="JOS 10:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:15"/><verse eid="JOS 10:15"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:16"/>And those five kings fled and hid themselves in the cave that was in Makeda.<verse eid="JOS 10:16"/>

    <verse sid="JOS 10:18"/>And Iesous said, "Roll stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men to guard over them.<verse eid="JOS 10:18"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:19"/>But you, do not stand in pursuing after your enemies, and lay hold of their rear guard. And do not let them enter into their cities, for the Lord our God has given them into our hands."<verse eid="JOS 10:19"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:20"/>And it happened, when Iesous and every son of Israel finished smiting them with a very great slaughter, all the way to the end, that those who survived sought survival in the strong cities.<verse eid="JOS 10:20"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 10:21"/>And all the people returned sound to Iesous to Makeda, and no one of the sons of Israel grumbled with his tongue.<verse eid="JOS 10:21"/>

    <verse sid="JOS 11:1"/>Now when Iabin, king of Hasor, heard, he sent to Iobab, king of Marron, and to the king of Symoon and to the king of Aziph<verse eid="JOS 11:1"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:2"/>and to the kings who were by Sidon the great, to the hill country and to Raba opposite Keneroth and to the plain and to Napheddor<verse eid="JOS 11:2"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:3"/>and to the coast-dwelling Chananites on the east and to the coast-dwelling Amorrite and the Heuites and the Iebousites and the Pherezites in the mountain and the Chettites, those under Haermon in the land of Massepha.<verse eid="JOS 11:3"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:4"/>And they came out, they and their kings with them, as the sand of the sea in multitude, and horses and very many chariots.<verse eid="JOS 11:4"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:5"/>And all these kings gathered and came to the same place and encamped at the water of Marron, to fight with Israel.<verse eid="JOS 11:5"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:6"/>And the Lord said to Iesous, "Do not be afraid before them, for tomorrow at this time I will deliver them, routed before Israel; you shall hamstring their horses and burn their chariots with fire."<verse eid="JOS 11:6"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:7"/>And Iesous-- and all the military people-- came upon them at the water of Marron suddenly, and they fell upon them in the hill country.<verse eid="JOS 11:7"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:8"/>And the Lord delivered them into the power of Israel, and as they smote them, they pursued them as far as Sidon the great and as far as Maseron and as far as the plains of Massoch to the east. And they cut them down until not one of them was left who survived.<verse eid="JOS 11:8"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:9"/>And Iesous did to them as the Lord commanded him; he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots with fire.<verse eid="JOS 11:9"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:10"/>And Iesous turned back at that time and took Hasor and its king. And Hasor was earlier chief of all those kingdoms.<verse eid="JOS 11:10"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:11"/>And they slew everything breathing in it with the rapier and utterly destroyed them all, and nothing breathing was left in it, and they burned Hasor with fire.<verse eid="JOS 11:11"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:12"/>And all the cities of the kings and their kings, Iesous took and killed them with the edge of the rapier and utterly destroyed them, as Moyses the servant of the Lord instructed.<verse eid="JOS 11:12"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:13"/>But all the cities fortified with mounds Israel did not burn, but Iesous burned only Hasor.<verse eid="JOS 11:13"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:14"/>And the sons of Israel appropriated all its spoils for themselves, but they completely destroyed all people with the edge of the rapier until he demolished them; they did not leave anything of them breathing.<verse eid="JOS 11:14"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:15"/>As the Lord instructed Moyses his servant, Moyses also commanded Iesous in like manner, and so Iesous did; he did not transgress anything of all that Moyses instructed him.<verse eid="JOS 11:15"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:16"/>And Iesous took all the land: the hill country and all the Nageb and all the land of Gosom and the plain and that toward the west and the mountain of Israel and the low regions<verse eid="JOS 11:16"/>

    <verse sid="JOS 11:18"/>And for rather many days Iesous made war with these kings.<verse eid="JOS 11:18"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:19"/>And there was not a city that Israel did not take; they took everything in war.<verse eid="JOS 11:19"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:20"/>For it was through the Lord to strengthen their heart to meet for war against Israel in order that they might be utterly destroyed, that mercy not be given to them, but that they be utterly destroyed, just as the Lord said to Moyses.<verse eid="JOS 11:20"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:21"/>And at that time Iesous came and utterly destroyed the Enakim out of the hill country, out of Chebron and out of Dabir and out of Anaboth and out of all the race of Israel and out of all the mountain of Ioudas with their cities, and Iesous utterly destroyed them.<verse eid="JOS 11:21"/>
    <verse sid="JOS 11:22"/>And none of the Enakim was left by the sons of Israel, but only in Gaza and in Geth and in Asedoth was anyone left.<verse eid="JOS 11:22"/>
