  <chapter sid="2KI 1"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:1"/>And Moab rebelled against Israel after Achaab died.<verse eid="2KI 1:1"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:2"/>And Ochozias fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria and was sick, and he sent messengers and told them, "Go, and inquire by the goddess Baal, fly god of Akkaron, whether I shall recover from this my sickness." And they went to inquire through him.<verse eid="2KI 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:3"/>And an angel of the Lord spoke to Eliou the Thesbite, saying, "Get up, go to meet the messengers of Ochozias, king of Samaria, and you shall say to them, 'Is it because there is no god in Israel that you are going to inquire by the goddess Baal, fly god of Akkaron?'<verse eid="2KI 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:4"/>And not so, for this is what the Lord says, 'The bed upon which you went up there, you shall not come down from it, for there by death you shall die.' " And Eliou went and spoke to them.<verse eid="2KI 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:5"/>And the messengers returned to him, and he said to them, "Why is it that you returned?"<verse eid="2KI 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:6"/>And they said to him, "A man came up to meet us and said to us, 'Go, return to the king who sent you, and you shall say to him: This is what the Lord says: Is it because there is no god in Israel that you are going to inquire by the goddess Baal, fly god of Akkaron? Not so; the bed upon which you went up there, you shall not come down from it, for by death you shall die.' "<verse eid="2KI 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:7"/>And he spoke to them, saying, "What was the judgment<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:7</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'means of judging'</char></note> of the man who went up to meet you and told you these words?"<verse eid="2KI 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:8"/>And they said to him, "A hairy man, and wearing a leather belt around his waist." And he said, "This is Eliou the Thesbite."<verse eid="2KI 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:9"/>And he sent to him a leader, an officer of fifty, and his fifty men. And he went up and came to him, and behold, Eliou was sitting on the top of the mountain. And the officer of fifty spoke to him and said, "O man of God, the king has summoned you, come down."<verse eid="2KI 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:10"/>And Eliou answered and said to the officer of fifty, "And if I am a man of God, fire will come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." And fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.<verse eid="2KI 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:11"/>And the king proceeded and sent to him another officer of fifty and his fifty. And he went up, and the captain of fifty spoke to him and said, "O man of God, this is what the king says: Come down quickly!"<verse eid="2KI 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:12"/>And Eliou answered and spoke to him and said, "If I am a man of God, fire will come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." And fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.<verse eid="2KI 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:13"/>And the king proceeded still to send a third leader, an officer of fifty, and his fifty. And the third officer of fifty went to him and knelt on his knees before Eliou and entreated him and spoke to him and said, "O man of God, do let my life and the life of these fifty slaves of yours be precious in your sight.<verse eid="2KI 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:14"/>Look, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former officers of fifties and their fifties, but now do let the life of your slaves be precious in your sight."<verse eid="2KI 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:15"/>And an angel of the Lord spoke to Eliou and said, "Go down with him; do not be afraid from before them." And Eliou set out and went down with him to the king.<verse eid="2KI 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:16"/>And he spoke to him, and Eliou said, "This is what the Lord says: Why is it that you sent messengers to inquire by the goddess Baal, fly god of Akkaron? Not so; the bed upon which you went up there, you shall not come down from it, for by death you shall die."<verse eid="2KI 1:16"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:17"/>And he died according to the word of the Lord that Eliou had spoken.<verse eid="2KI 1:17"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 1:18"/>And the rest of the histories of Ochozias, what he did, behold, are these things not written in a book of Histories of the Days for the Kings of Israel?(18a) And Ioram son of Achaab reigns over Israel in Samaria twelve years in the eighteenth year of Iosaphat, king of Iouda. (18b) And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, yet not like his brothers nor like his mother. (18c) And he removed the steles of Baal that his father had made and broke them in pieces. Yet, he clung to the sins of the house of Ieroboam who made Israel sin; he did not depart from them. (18d) And the Lord was inflamed with anger against the house of Achaab.<verse eid="2KI 1:18"/>



  <chapter sid="2KI 2"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:1"/>And it happened, when the Lord was about to take Eliou up by a whirlwind as into heaven, that Eliou and Elisaie went from Galgala.<verse eid="2KI 2:1"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:2"/>And Eliou said to Elisaie, "Do stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as Baithel." And Elisaie said, "The Lord lives, and your soul lives, if I will leave you!" And they came to Baithel.<verse eid="2KI 2:2"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:3"/>And the sons of the prophets who were in Baithel came to Elisaie and said to him, "Did you know that today the Lord is taking your master from above your head?" And he said, "Yes, I know; keep silent."<verse eid="2KI 2:3"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:4"/>And Eliou said to Elisaie, "Do stay here, for the Lord has sent me to Iericho." And Elisaie said, "The Lord lives, and your soul lives, if I will abandon you!" And they came to Iericho.<verse eid="2KI 2:4"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:5"/>And the sons of the prophets who were in Iericho drew near to Elisaie and said to him, "Did you know that today the Lord is taking your master from above your head?" And he said, "And indeed I know; be silent."<verse eid="2KI 2:5"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:6"/>And Eliou said to him, "Do stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as the Jordan." And Elisaie said, "The Lord lives, and your soul lives, if I will abandon you!" And they both went on.<verse eid="2KI 2:6"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:7"/>And fifty men, sons of the prophets, also stood opposite at a distance, and they both stood by the Jordan.<verse eid="2KI 2:7"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:8"/>And Eliou took his sheepskin and rolled it up and struck the water, and the water was divided here and there, and they both crossed in a wilderness<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:8</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'a wilderness':  Or 'solitude'</char></note>.<verse eid="2KI 2:8"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:9"/>And it happened, when they had crossed, that Eliou said to Elisaie, "Ask what I may do for you, before I am taken from you." And Elisaie said, "Do let twofold in your spirit be on me."<verse eid="2KI 2:9"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:10"/>And Eliou said, "You made hard to ask this for yourself; if you see me as I am being taken up from you, then it will be so for you, and if not, it will not be."<verse eid="2KI 2:10"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:11"/>And it happened, as they walked, that they were walking and talking, and behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire, and they separated between both, and Eliou was taken up in a whirlwind as into heaven.<verse eid="2KI 2:11"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:12"/>And Elisaie kept watching and crying out, "Father, Father! Chariot of Israel and its horseman!" And he saw him no longer, and he grasped his clothes and tore them into two tears.<verse eid="2KI 2:12"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:13"/>And he picked up the sheepskin of Eliou that fell from upon Elisaie, and Elisaie went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.<verse eid="2KI 2:13"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:14"/>And he took the sheepskin of Eliou that fell from upon him and struck the water, and it did not part, and he said, "Where is the God of Eliou-- aphpho<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'even he'</char></note>?" And he struck the waters, and they burst here and there, and Elisaie went over.<verse eid="2KI 2:14"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:15"/>And the sons of the prophets who were in Iericho saw him opposite and said, "The spirit of Eliou rests on Elisaie." And they came to meet him and did obeisance to him on the ground.<verse eid="2KI 2:15"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:16"/>And they said to him, "See now, with your servants there are fifty men, sons of power; as they go, do let them seek your master; it may be that a spirit of the Lord picked him up and threw him in the Jordan or on one of the mountains or on one of the hills." And Elisaie said, "You shall not send."<verse eid="2KI 2:16"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:17"/>And they urged him until he was ashamed, and he said, "Send." And they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days but did not find him.<verse eid="2KI 2:17"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:18"/>And they came back to him (and he had remained in Iericho) , and Elisaie said, "Did I not say to you, Do not go?"<verse eid="2KI 2:18"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:19"/>And the men of the city said to Elisaie, "Behold, the location of the city is good, as our lord sees, but the waters are bad, and the land is deprived of children."<verse eid="2KI 2:19"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:20"/>And Elisaie said, "Bring me a new bowl, and put salt there." And they brought it to him.<verse eid="2KI 2:20"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:21"/>And Elisaie went out to the outlet of the waters and threw the salt there and said, "This is what the Lord says, I have healed these waters; no longer shall there be death nor a lack of children from there."<verse eid="2KI 2:21"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:22"/>And the waters have been healed to this day, according to the word of Elisaie that he spoke.<verse eid="2KI 2:22"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:23"/>And he went up from there to Baithel, and while he was going up on the way, small children also came out of the city and jeered at him and said to him, "Go up, baldhead! Go up!"<verse eid="2KI 2:23"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:24"/>And he turned aside after them and saw them and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And behold, two bears came out of the wood and tore open forty-two children of them.<verse eid="2KI 2:24"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 2:25"/>And he went on from there to the Carmelite mountain and from there returned to Samaria.<verse eid="2KI 2:25"/>



  <chapter sid="2KI 3"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:1"/>And Ioram son of Achaab became king in Israel in the eighteenth year of Iosaphat, king of Iouda, and he reigned twelve years.<verse eid="2KI 3:1"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:2"/>And he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, yet not like his father and not like his mother, and he removed the steles of Baal that his father had made.<verse eid="2KI 3:2"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:3"/>Yet, he clung to the sin of Ieroboam son of Nabat, who made Israel sin; he did not depart from it.<verse eid="2KI 3:3"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:4"/>And Mosa, king of Moab, was noked<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'a sheep breeder'</char></note>, and he used to return to the king of Israel at the rising<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'at the rising':  Perhaps 'at the rising of the year'</char></note> one hundred thousand lambs and one hundred thousand rams, based on wool.<verse eid="2KI 3:4"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:5"/>And it happened, after Achaab died, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.<verse eid="2KI 3:5"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:6"/>And King Ioram went out of Samaria in that day and inspected Israel.<verse eid="2KI 3:6"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:7"/>And he went and sent to Iosaphat, king of Iouda, saying, "The king of Moab rebelled against me; will you go with me to Moab to battle?" And he said, "I will go up; like me, like you; as my people are your people, as my horses are your horses."<verse eid="2KI 3:7"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:8"/>And he said, "By which way should I go up?" And he said, "The way of the wilderness of Edom."<verse eid="2KI 3:8"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:9"/>And the king of Israel set out, and the king of Iouda and the king of Edom, and they circled around a journey of seven days, and there was no water for the camp or for the animals that were at their feet.<verse eid="2KI 3:9"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:10"/>And the king of Israel said, "O, for the Lord has summoned the three kings passing by, to give them into the hand of Moab."<verse eid="2KI 3:10"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:11"/>And Iosaphat said, "Is there no prophet of the Lord here? And let us inquire of the Lord through him." And one of the servants of the king of Israel answered and said, "Elisaie son of Saphat, who poured water on the hands of Eliou, is here."<verse eid="2KI 3:11"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:12"/>And Iosaphat said, "He has a word of the Lord." And the king of Israel and Iosaphat, king of Iouda, and the king of Edom went down to him.<verse eid="2KI 3:12"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:13"/>And Elisaie said to the king of Israel, "What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father." And the king of Israel said to him, "No, for the Lord has summoned the three kings to hand them over to the hands of Moab."<verse eid="2KI 3:13"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:14"/>And Elisaie said, "The Lord of hosts before whom I stand lives, unless I regard the person of Iosaphat, king of Iouda, if I had looked at you and seen you!<verse eid="2KI 3:14"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:15"/>But as it is, get me a harpist." And it happened, as the harpist was playing, that the hand of the Lord came upon him.<verse eid="2KI 3:15"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:16"/>And he said, "This is what the Lord says, 'Make this wadi atroughs by troughs<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:16</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'into troughs'</char></note>.'<verse eid="2KI 3:16"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:17"/>For this is what the Lord says, 'You shall not see wind, and you shall not see rain, and this wadi shall be filled with water, and you shall drink, you and your possessions and your animals.<verse eid="2KI 3:17"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:18"/>And this<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:18</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'into troughs'</char></note> is easy in the sight of the Lord, and I will hand over Moab in your hand.<verse eid="2KI 3:18"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:19"/>And you shall strike every strong city, and every good tree you shall fell, and all springs of water you shall stop up, and every good portion of land<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'of land':  Lacking in Greek</char></note> you shall ruin with stones.' "<verse eid="2KI 3:19"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:20"/>And it happened in the morning, when the offering was going up, and behold, waters were coming from the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.<verse eid="2KI 3:20"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:21"/>And all Moab heard that the kings had come up to fight them, and they called out, from everyone wearing a belt<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:21</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'wearing a belt':  I.e. 'old enough to fight'</char></note> and upward, and they stood at the frontier.<verse eid="2KI 3:21"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:22"/>And they rose early in the morning, and the sun rose over the waters, and Moab saw the waters opposite, red as blood.<verse eid="2KI 3:22"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:23"/>And they said, "This is blood of the sword; the kings had a fight, and they struck, a man his neighbor. And now, to the spoils, Moab!"<verse eid="2KI 3:23"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:24"/>And they entered into the camp of Israel, and Israel rose up, and they struck Moab, and they fled from before them, and they entered Moab, going in and beating.<verse eid="2KI 3:24"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:25"/>And the cities they overturned, and on every good portion of land<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:25</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'of land':  Lacking in Greek</char></note> they threw, a man his stone, and they filled it, and every spring of water they stopped up, and every good tree they felled until they left the stones of the wall overturned, and the slingers surrounded and struck it<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:25</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Antecedent unclear</char></note>.<verse eid="2KI 3:25"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:26"/>And the king of Moab saw that the battle prevailed over him, and he took with him seven hundred men who drew sword to break through to the king of Edom, but they could not.<verse eid="2KI 3:26"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 3:27"/>And he took his firstborn son who became king in his stead and offered him up as a whole burnt offering on the wall. And great regret came upon Israel, and they withdrew from him and returned to their land.<verse eid="2KI 3:27"/>



  <chapter sid="2KI 4"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:1"/>And one woman from the sons of the prophets cried to Elisaie, saying, "Your slave, my husband, died, and you knew that he was a slave who feared the Lord, and the creditor came to take my two sons for himself as slaves."<verse eid="2KI 4:1"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:2"/>And Elisaie said, "What shall I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?" And she said, "Your slave has nothing in the house, but for oil with which I shall anoint myself."<verse eid="2KI 4:2"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:3"/>And he said to her, "Come on, ask for yourself vessels outside from all your neighbors, empty vessels; don't make them few.<verse eid="2KI 4:3"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:4"/>And you shall enter and shut the door upon you and upon your sons, and you shall pour out into these vessels, and that which has been filled, you shall remove."<verse eid="2KI 4:4"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:5"/>And she departed from him and did so and shut the door upon her and upon her sons; they kept coming near to her, and she kept pouring in<verse eid="2KI 4:5"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:6"/>until the vessels were filled. And she said to her sons, "Bring yet to me a vessel." And they said to her, "There is no longer a vessel." And the oil stopped.<verse eid="2KI 4:6"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:7"/>And she came and told the man of God, and Elisaie said, "Come on, and sell the oil, and you shall pay your interests, and you and your sons shall live by the remaining oil."<verse eid="2KI 4:7"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:8"/>And a day came, and Elisaie passed through to Souman, and a great woman was there, and she prevailed on him to eat bread. And it happened after enough of his entrances that he turned aside to eat there.<verse eid="2KI 4:8"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:9"/>And the woman said to her husband, "Look, indeed I knew that this man was a holy man of God; he regularly passes through to us.<verse eid="2KI 4:9"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:10"/>Let us now make for him an upper chamber, a small place, and put for him there a bed and a table and a chair and a lampstand, and it shall be, when he enters to us, that he shall turn aside there."<verse eid="2KI 4:10"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:11"/>And a day came, and he entered there and turned aside to the upper chamber and lay down there.<verse eid="2KI 4:11"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:12"/>And he said to Giezi, his lad, "Call to me this Somanite woman." And he called her, and she stood before him.<verse eid="2KI 4:12"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:13"/>And he said to him, "Do say to her, Behold, you amazed us with all this amazement; what must be done for you? Is it a word on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the force?" And she said, "I am-- I live among my own people."<verse eid="2KI 4:13"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:14"/>And he said, "What must be done for her?" And Giezi, his lad, said, "Actually, she has no son, and her husband is old."<verse eid="2KI 4:14"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:15"/>And he called her, and she stood at the door.<verse eid="2KI 4:15"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:16"/>And Elisaie said to her, "At this season, as the time is ripe, you shall have embraced a son." But she said, "No, my lord, do not deceive your slave."<verse eid="2KI 4:16"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:17"/>And the woman conceived and bore a son at this season, as the time was ripe, as Elisaie said to her.<verse eid="2KI 4:17"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:18"/>And the child matured, and it happened, when the child went out to his father to the reapers,<verse eid="2KI 4:18"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:19"/>that he said to his father, "My head, my head!" And he said to his lad, "Carry him to his mother."<verse eid="2KI 4:19"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:20"/>And he carried him to his mother, and he lay down on her knees until noon, and he died.<verse eid="2KI 4:20"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:21"/>And she carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of God and closed upon him and went out.<verse eid="2KI 4:21"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:22"/>And she called her husband and said, "Do send me one of the lads and one of the donkeys, and I shall go quickly to the man of God and come back."<verse eid="2KI 4:22"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:23"/>And he said, "Why is it that you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath." And she said, "Peace."<verse eid="2KI 4:23"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:24"/>And she saddled the donkey and said to her lad, "Lead, go; do not hold back for me to mount, for if I tell you . . . !<verse eid="2KI 4:24"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:25"/>Come on, and you shall go and come to the man of God at the Carmelite mountain." And it happened, as Elisaie saw her coming, that he said to Giezi, his lad, "Look, indeed there is that Somanite woman;<verse eid="2KI 4:25"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:26"/>now run to meet her, and you shall say, Do you have peace? Does your husband have peace? Does the child have peace?" And she said, "Peace."<verse eid="2KI 4:26"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:27"/>And she came to Elisaie at the mountain, and she caught hold of his feet. And Giezi approached to push her away. And Elisaie said, "Let her alone, for her soul is painful to her, and the Lord hid it from me and did not tell me."<verse eid="2KI 4:27"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:28"/>Then she said, "Did I ask for a son from my lord? Did I not say, You shall not go astray with me?"<verse eid="2KI 4:28"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:29"/>And Elisaie said to Giezi, "Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go, for if you meet a man, you shall not bless him, and if a man blesses you, you shall not answer him, and you shall lay my staff on the face of the child."<verse eid="2KI 4:29"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:30"/>And the mother of the child said, "The Lord lives, and your soul lives, if I will abandon you!" And Elisaie rose up and went after her.<verse eid="2KI 4:30"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:31"/>And Giezi went on ahead of her and laid the staff on the face of the child, but there was no sound, and there was no hearing. And he went back to meet him and told him, saying, "The child was not awakened."<verse eid="2KI 4:31"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:32"/>And Elisaie entered into the house, and behold, the child was lying dead on his bed.<verse eid="2KI 4:32"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:33"/>And Elisaie entered into the house and closed the door upon the two of them and prayed to the Lord.<verse eid="2KI 4:33"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:34"/>And he went up and lay upon the child, and he put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands, and he bent over him, and the flesh of the child was warmed.<verse eid="2KI 4:34"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:35"/>And he turned around and walked to and fro in the house and went up and bent over the child until seven times, and the child opened his eyes.<verse eid="2KI 4:35"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:36"/>And Elisaie cried out to Giezi and said, "Call this Somanite woman." And he called, and she came in to him. And Elisaie said, "Take your son."<verse eid="2KI 4:36"/>

    <verse sid="2KI 4:38"/>And Elisaie returned to Galgala, and the famine was in the land, and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him. And Elisaie said to his lad, "Put the large cauldron on, and boil boiled stuff for the sons of the prophets."<verse eid="2KI 4:38"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:39"/>And one went out into the field to gather arioth<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:39</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'herbs'</char></note>, and he found a vine in the field and gathered from it a wild gourd, his garment full, and he threw it into the cauldron of boiled stuff, for they knew it not.<verse eid="2KI 4:39"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:40"/>And he poured it in for the men to eat. And it happened, while they were eating from the boiled stuff, that behold, they cried out and said, "O man of God, there is death in the cauldron!" And they could not eat it.<verse eid="2KI 4:40"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 4:41"/>And he said, "Bring flour, and throw it into the cauldron." And Elisaie said to Giezi the lad, "Pour for the people, and let them eat." And there was no longer any harmful thing there in the cauldron.<verse eid="2KI 4:41"/>

  <chapter sid="2KI 5"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:1"/>And Naiman, the commander of the force of Syria, was a great man before his master and was marveled at in face<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">5:1</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'marveled at in face':  I.e.

    <verse sid="2KI 5:2"/>And as for Syria, they went out lightly armed and took captive from the land of Israel a little girl, and she was in the presence of the wife of Naiman.<verse eid="2KI 5:2"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:3"/>And she said to her mistress, "Would that my lord were in the presence of the prophet of God who is in Samaria! Then he will recover him from his leprosy."<verse eid="2KI 5:3"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:4"/>And she went in and told her own lord and said, "Thus and so said the girl from the land of Israel."<verse eid="2KI 5:4"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:5"/>And the king of Syria said to Naiman, "Come here, enter, and I will send out a document to the king of Israel." And he went and took in his hand ten talents of silver and six thousand gold pieces and ten changes of robes.<verse eid="2KI 5:5"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:6"/>And he brought the document to the king of Israel, saying, "And now, as soon as this document comes to you, behold, I sent to you Naiman my slave, and you shall recover him from his leprosy."<verse eid="2KI 5:6"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:7"/>And it happened, as the king of Israel read the document, that he tore his clothes and said, "Am I a god, to put to death and to make alive, that this man sends to me to recover a man from his leprosy? For only know now, and see, that this man is setting me up as an excuse."<verse eid="2KI 5:7"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:8"/>And it happened, as Elisaie heard that the king of Israel had torn his own clothes, that he sent to the king of Israel, saying, "Why did you tear your clothes? Do let Naiman come to me, and let him know that there is a prophet in Israel."<verse eid="2KI 5:8"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:9"/>And Naiman came in horse and chariot and stood at the door of the house of Elisaie.<verse eid="2KI 5:9"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:10"/>And Elisaie sent a messenger to him, saying, "Going, wash seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh shall return to you, and you shall be cleansed."<verse eid="2KI 5:10"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:11"/>And Naiman became angry and went away and said, "Behold now, I kept saying that he will come out to me and stand and call out in the name of his god and lay his hand on the place and recover the leprosy!<verse eid="2KI 5:11"/>

    <verse sid="2KI 5:14"/>And Naiman went down and immersed himself in the Jordan seven times, according to the word of Elisaie, and his flesh returned like the flesh of a small child, and he was cleansed.<verse eid="2KI 5:14"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:15"/>And he returned to Elisaie, he and all his camp, and he came and stood and said, "Behold, indeed I know that there is no god in all the earth but only in Israel, and now accept the blessing from your slave."<verse eid="2KI 5:15"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:16"/>And Elisaie said, "The Lord lives, before whom I stand, if I will accept it!" And he urged him to accept, but he refused.<verse eid="2KI 5:16"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:17"/>And Naiman said, "And if not, do let there be given to your slave a load of a pair of mules, and you shall give me from the red earth, for your slave will no longer make whole burnt offering and sacrifice to other gods except to the Lord alone.<verse eid="2KI 5:17"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:18"/>And the Lord will have mercy on your slave when my master enters into Remman's house to do obeisance to him, and he will rest on my arm, and I will do obeisance in Remman's house, when he does obeisance in Remman's house, and then the Lord will have mercy on your slave in this matter."<verse eid="2KI 5:18"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:19"/>And Elisaie said to Naiman, "Go in peace." And he went away from him for debratha<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">5:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'a short distance'</char></note> of the land.<verse eid="2KI 5:19"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:20"/>And Giezi, the lad of Elisaie, said, "Behold, my master spared Naiman, this Syrian, by not accepting from his hand what he brought. The Lord lives, for I will surely run after him and get something from him."<verse eid="2KI 5:20"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:21"/>And Giezi hurried after Naiman. And Naiman saw him running after him, and he turned around from the chariot to meet him.<verse eid="2KI 5:21"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:22"/>And he said, "Peace. My master sent me, saying, 'Behold now, there came to me two lads from Mount Ephraim from the sons of the prophets; do give them a talent of silver and two changes of robes.' "<verse eid="2KI 5:22"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:23"/>And Naiman said, "Accept two talents of silver." And he accepted it in two bags, with two changes of robes, and put them on two of his lads, and they carried them in front of him.<verse eid="2KI 5:23"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:24"/>And they came into the darkness<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">5:24</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Perhaps 'secret place'</char></note>, and he took from their hands and stored the things in a house, and he dismissed the men.<verse eid="2KI 5:24"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:25"/>And he went in and stood near by his master, and Elisaie said to him, "Where have you come from, Giezi?" And Giezi said, "Your slave has not gone here or there."<verse eid="2KI 5:25"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:26"/>And Elisaie said to him, "Did my heart not go with you when the man turned around from the chariot to meet you? Even now you accepted the silver; even now you accepted the clothing, and shall you receive by him gardens and olive orchards and vineyards and sheep and cattle and male servants and female servants?<verse eid="2KI 5:26"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 5:27"/>And the leprosy of Naiman shall cling to you and to your offspring forever." And he went out of his presence leprous, as if snow.<verse eid="2KI 5:27"/>



  <chapter sid="2KI 6"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:1"/>And the sons of the prophets said to Elisaie, "See now, the place where we live in your presence is too narrow for us.<verse eid="2KI 6:1"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:2"/>Do let us go to the Jordan, and let us take from there, one man, one beam, and build for ourselves there to live there." And he said, "Go."<verse eid="2KI 6:2"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:3"/>And the one said, "Kindly come with your slaves." And he said, "I will go."<verse eid="2KI 6:3"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:4"/>And he went with them. And they came to the Jordan and cut down trees.<verse eid="2KI 6:4"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:5"/>And behold, the one was felling the beam, and the iron fell into the water, and he cried out, "O master! And it was borrowed!"<verse eid="2KI 6:5"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:6"/>And the man of God said, "Where did it fall?" And he showed him the place. And he cut off a stick and threw it there, and the iron floated.<verse eid="2KI 6:6"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:7"/>And he said, "Raise it for yourself." And he reached out his hand and took it.<verse eid="2KI 6:7"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:8"/>And the king of Syria was at war with Israel, and he took counsel with his servants, saying, "I will encamp at this certain place, Elmoni."<verse eid="2KI 6:8"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:9"/>And Elisaie sent to the king of Israel, saying, "Take care not to pass by this place, because Syria is hidden there."<verse eid="2KI 6:9"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:10"/>And the king of Israel sent to the place which Elisaie told him. And he avoided it not once or twice.<verse eid="2KI 6:10"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:11"/>And the mind of the king of Syria was perturbed about this matter, and he called his servants and said to them, "Will you not tell me who is betraying me to the king of Israel?"<verse eid="2KI 6:11"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:12"/>And one of his servants said, "No one, my lord O king, for Elisaie the prophet in Israel tells the king of Israel all the words that you might speak in the chamber of your bedroom."<verse eid="2KI 6:12"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:13"/>And he said, "Go, see where this man is, and after I send, I will seize him." And they reported to him, saying, "Behold, he is in Dothaim."<verse eid="2KI 6:13"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:14"/>And he sent there horse and chariot and a heavy force, and they came by night and surrounded the city.<verse eid="2KI 6:14"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:15"/>And the attendant of Elisaie rose early in the morning and went out, and behold, a force was all around the city with horse and chariot. And the lad said to him, "O master! What shall we do?"<verse eid="2KI 6:15"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:16"/>And Elisaie said, "Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them."<verse eid="2KI 6:16"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:17"/>And Elisaie prayed and said, "O Lord, open the eyes of the lad, and let him see." And the Lord opened his eyes, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses, and there was a chariot of fire all around Elisaie.<verse eid="2KI 6:17"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:18"/>And they came down against him. And Elisaie prayed to the Lord and said, "Do strike this nation with blindness." And he struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisaie.<verse eid="2KI 6:18"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:19"/>And Elisaie said to them, "This is not the city, and this is not the way; come after me, and I will lead you to the man whom you seek." And he led them to Samaria.<verse eid="2KI 6:19"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:20"/>And it happened, as they entered into Samaria, that Elisaie said, "O Lord, do open their eyes, and let them see." And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw, and behold, they were in the middle of Samaria.<verse eid="2KI 6:20"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:21"/>And the king of Israel said, when he saw them, "Father, striking shall I strike?"<verse eid="2KI 6:21"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:22"/>And he said, "You shall not strike; if you did not capture them with your sword and your bow, would you strike them? Serve up food and water before them, and let them eat and drink, and let them go to their master."<verse eid="2KI 6:22"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:23"/>And he served up before them a great serving, and they ate and drank, and he sent them, and they went to their master. And lightly armed men of Syria no longer continued to come into the land of Israel.<verse eid="2KI 6:23"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:24"/>And it happened after this that the son of Hader, king of Syria, mustered all his camp and went up and besieged Samaria.<verse eid="2KI 6:24"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:25"/>And there was a great famine in Samaria, and behold, they besieged it until a donkey's head was fifty shekels of silver, and the fourth of a kab<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">6:25</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'the fourth of a kab':  Hebrew 1 kab = 1 liter</char></note> of doves' dung was five shekels of silver.<verse eid="2KI 6:25"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:26"/>And the king of Israel was passing by on the city wall, and a woman cried out to him, saying, "Save, O lord king!"<verse eid="2KI 6:26"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:27"/>And he said to her, "No! May the Lord save you. How can I save you? Surely not from the threshing floor or from the wine press?"<verse eid="2KI 6:27"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:28"/>And the king said to her, "What is it with you?" And she said, "This woman said to me, 'Give up your son, and we will eat him today, and my son, we will also eat him tomorrow.'<verse eid="2KI 6:28"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:29"/>And we boiled my son and ate him, and I said to her on the second day, 'Give up your son, and let us eat him.' But she hid her son."<verse eid="2KI 6:29"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:30"/>And it happened, when the king of Israel heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes-- and he was passing by on the city wall-- and the people saw the sackcloth on his flesh underneath.<verse eid="2KI 6:30"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:31"/>And he said, "This is what God may do to me, and this is what he may add, if the head of Elisaie shall stand firm upon him today."<verse eid="2KI 6:31"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:32"/>And Elisaie was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And he<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">6:32</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'the king'</char></note> sent a man before his presence. Before the messenger came to him, he also said to the elders, "Are you aware that this son of the murderer sent someone to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and detain him at the door. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"<verse eid="2KI 6:32"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 6:33"/>He was still speaking with them, and behold, a messenger came down to him and said, "Behold, this trouble is from the Lord! Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?"<verse eid="2KI 6:33"/>



  <chapter sid="2KI 7"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:1"/>And Elisaie said, "Hear a word of the Lord; this is what the Lord says, About this time tomorrow a measure of fine flour for a shekel and a double measure of barley for a shekel, in the gates of Samaria."<verse eid="2KI 7:1"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:2"/>And the number-three man, on whose hand the king rested on it, answered Elisaie and said, "Behold, the Lord will make cataracts in heaven; this thing will not be, will it?" And Elisaie said, "Behold, you shall see with your own eyes, but you shall not eat from there."<verse eid="2KI 7:2"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:3"/>And there were four leprous men by the gate of the city, and a man said to his neighbor, "Why should we sit here until we die?<verse eid="2KI 7:3"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:4"/>If we say, 'Let us enter into the city,' and the famine is in the city, and we shall die there, and if we sit here, we shall also die.

    <verse sid="2KI 7:5"/>And they arose in the darkness, to enter into the camp of Syria, and they came into a part of the camp of Syria, and behold, there was no man there.<verse eid="2KI 7:5"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:6"/>And the Lord caused the camp of Syria to hear a sound of chariot and a sound of horse and a sound of a great force, and a man said to his brother, "Now the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Chettites and the kings of Egypt to come against us."<verse eid="2KI 7:6"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:7"/>And they arose and fled in the darkness and abandoned their tents and their horses and their donkeys in the camp as it was and fled for their own life.<verse eid="2KI 7:7"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:8"/>And these leprous men entered to a part of the camp, and they entered into one tent and ate and drank and carried away from there silver and gold and clothing and went, and they came back and entered into another tent and took from there and went and hid it.<verse eid="2KI 7:8"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:9"/>And a man said to his neighbor, "Not in this manner we are acting. This day is a day of good news, and we are silent and waiting until the morning light, and we will find lawlessness, and now come, and let us enter and report in the house of the king."<verse eid="2KI 7:9"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:10"/>And they entered and called toward the gate of the city and reported to them, saying, "We entered into the camp of Syria, and behold, there is no man nor human voice there but only a tied horse and a donkey and their tents as they are."<verse eid="2KI 7:10"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:11"/>And the gatekeepers called out and reported to the house of the king within.<verse eid="2KI 7:11"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:12"/>And the king got up at night and said to his servants, "I will now tell you what Syria did to us. They know that we are hungry, and they went out of the camp and hid in the field, saying, 'They will come out of the city, and we shall take them alive and enter into the city.' "<verse eid="2KI 7:12"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:13"/>And one of his servants answered and said, "Do let them take five of the remaining horses, which were left here; behold, it is for all the departed multitude of Israel, and we shall send there and look."<verse eid="2KI 7:13"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:14"/>And they took two mounted on horses, and the king of Israel sent them after the king of Syria, saying, "Go, and see."<verse eid="2KI 7:14"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:15"/>And they went after them as far as the Jordan, and behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels which Syria had thrown away in their alarm. And the messengers returned and told the king.<verse eid="2KI 7:15"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:16"/>And the people went out and plundered the camp of Syria. And there was a measure of fine flour for a shekel and a double measure of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.<verse eid="2KI 7:16"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:17"/>And the king appointed the number-three man, on whose hand the king rested on it, over the gate, and the people trampled him in the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had spoken, who spoke when the messenger came down to him.<verse eid="2KI 7:17"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:18"/>And it happened just as Elisaie had spoken to the king, saying, "A double measure of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, and it will be about this time tomorrow in the gate of Samaria."<verse eid="2KI 7:18"/>
    <verse sid="2KI 7:19"/>And the number-three man answered Elisaie and said, "Behold, the Lord makes cataracts in heaven; this thing will not be, will it?" And Elisaie said, "Behold, you shall see with your own eyes, but you shall not eat from there."<verse eid="2KI 7:19"/>
