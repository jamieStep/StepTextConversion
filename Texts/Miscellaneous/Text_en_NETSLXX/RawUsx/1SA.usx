  <chapter sid="1SA 1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:1"/>There was a man of Harmathaim Sipha from the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkana son of Ieremeel son of Eliou son of Thoke, in Nasib Ephraim.<verse eid="1SA 1:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:2"/>And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hanna, and the name of the second Phennana. And Phennana had children, and Hanna had no child.<verse eid="1SA 1:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:3"/>And the man used to go up from days to days<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:3</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'days to days':  I.e. 'time to time'</char></note> from his town, from Harmathaim, to do obeisance and to sacrifice to the Lord God Sabaoth at Selo, and there Eli and his two sons, Hophni and Phinees, were priests of the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 1:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:4"/>And it happened on a day and Elkana sacrificed and gave portions to his wife Phennana and to her sons<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Rahlfs = + 'and her daughters'</char></note>,<verse eid="1SA 1:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:5"/>and to Hanna he gave one portion, because she did not have a child; however, Elkana loved Hanna more than this one, and the Lord had closed the area of her womb.<verse eid="1SA 1:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:6"/>Since the Lord did not give her a child according to her affliction and according to the despondency of her affliction, she was also becoming despondent because of this, that the Lord had closed the area of her womb so as not to give her a child.<verse eid="1SA 1:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:7"/>Thus she used to do year by year, when she would go up to the house of the Lord, and she would be despondent and would weep and not eat.<verse eid="1SA 1:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:8"/>And her husband Elkana said to her, "Hanna," and she said to him, "Here I am, sir." And he said to her, "How is it that you are weeping? And why do you not eat? And why does your heart smite you? Am I not good to you beyond ten children?"<verse eid="1SA 1:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:9"/>And after they had eaten at Selo, Hanna rose and stood before the Lord, and Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorposts of the shrine of the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 1:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:10"/>And she was deeply distressed in soul and prayed to the Lord, and weeping she wept<verse eid="1SA 1:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:11"/>and vowed a vow to the Lord, saying: "Adonai, Lord, Eloai, Sabaoth, if looking you will look on the humiliation of your slave and remember me and give to your slave an offspring of men, and I will give him as one devoted before you until the day of his death, and wine and strong drink he shall not drink, and no iron shall come upon his head."<verse eid="1SA 1:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:12"/>And it happened, as she continued praying before the Lord, that Eli the priest observed her mouth;<verse eid="1SA 1:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:13"/>and she was speaking in her heart, and her lips kept moving, and her voice was not heard, and Eli reckoned her as drunk.<verse eid="1SA 1:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:14"/>And the servant of Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunk? Put away your wine, and go out from the presence of the Lord."<verse eid="1SA 1:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:15"/>And Hanna answered and said, "No, sir; I am a woman for whom this is a hard day; I have not drunk wine and strong drink, and I am pouring out my soul before the Lord;<verse eid="1SA 1:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:16"/>do not regard your slave as a pestilent daughter, because I have been greatly extending my mumblings until now."<verse eid="1SA 1:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:17"/>And Eli answered and said to her, "Go in peace; may the God of Israel grant you your every request which you have requested of him."<verse eid="1SA 1:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:18"/>And she said, "Your slave has found favor in your sight." And the woman went on her way and entered her quarters and ate and drank with her husband, and her countenance was sad no longer.<verse eid="1SA 1:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:19"/>And they rose early in the morning and did obeisance to the Lord and went their way. And Elkana entered into his house at Harmathaim, and he knew his wife Hanna, and the Lord remembered her,<verse eid="1SA 1:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:20"/>and she conceived. And it happened at the season of days<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:20</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'at the season of days':  I.e. 'in due time'</char></note> that she bore a son, and she called his name Samouel, and she said, "Because I have requested him of the Lord God Sabaoth."<verse eid="1SA 1:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:21"/>And the man Elkana and all his household went up to offer in Selom the sacrifice of the days<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:21</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'sacrifice of the days':  I.e. 'yearly sacrifice'</char></note> and his vows and all the tithes of his land,<verse eid="1SA 1:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:22"/>and Hanna did not go up with him, for she said to her husband, "Until the boy goes up if I shall wean it, and it will appear to the face of the Lord and stay there forever."<verse eid="1SA 1:22"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:23"/>And her husband Elkana said to her, "Do what is good in your sight; stay until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish that which goes out of your mouth." And the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.<verse eid="1SA 1:23"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:24"/>And she went up with him to Selom with a three-year-old bull calf and bread and an oiphi<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:24</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 ephah = 22 liters</char></note> of flour and a nebel<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:24</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'skin'</char></note> of wine, and she entered into the house of the Lord at Selom, and the boy was with them.<verse eid="1SA 1:24"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:25"/>And they brought him before the Lord, and his father slaughtered the sacrifice that he used to do from days to days<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">1:25</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'days to days':  I.e. 'time to time'</char></note> to the Lord, and he brought the boy near and slaughtered the bull calf. And Hanna, the mother of the child, brought it to Eli<verse eid="1SA 1:25"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:26"/>and said, "By me, sir! Your soul lives, I am the woman who stood before you when praying to the Lord;<verse eid="1SA 1:26"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:27"/>for this boy I prayed, and the Lord has granted me my request that I requested of him.<verse eid="1SA 1:27"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 1:28"/>And I lend him to the Lord as long as he lives, a loan to the Lord."<verse eid="1SA 1:28"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:1"/>And she said, "My heart was made firm in the Lord; my horn was exalted in my god; my mouth was made wide against enemies; I was glad in your deliverance,<verse eid="1SA 2:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:2"/>because there is none holy like the Lord, and there is none righteous like our God; there is none holy besides you.<verse eid="1SA 2:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:3"/>"Boast not, and speak not lofty things; let not big talking come forth from your mouth, because the Lord is a god of knowledge, and a god who prepares his own ways.<verse eid="1SA 2:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:4"/>The bow of the mighty has become weak, and weak ones have girded themselves with might;<verse eid="1SA 2:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:5"/>full of bread they suffered loss, and the hungry have forsaken the land, because a barren one has borne seven, and she who is rich in children became weak.<verse eid="1SA 2:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:6"/>The Lord puts to death and brings to life; he brings down to Hades and brings up.<verse eid="1SA 2:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:7"/>The Lord makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, and he raises on high.<verse eid="1SA 2:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:8"/>He raises up the needy from the ground and lifts the poor from the dunghill, to make them sit with the mighty of the peoples, even making them inherit a throne of glory.<verse eid="1SA 2:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:9"/>"Granting the prayer to the one who prays, he has even blessed the years of the righteous, because not by strength is a man mighty.<verse eid="1SA 2:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:10"/>The Lord will make his adversary weak; the Lord is holy. Let not the clever boast in his cleverness, and let not let the mighty boast in his might, and let not let the wealthy boast in his wealth, but let him who boasts boast in this: to understand and know the Lord and to execute justice and righteousness in the midst of the land. The Lord ascended to the heavens and thundered. He will judge earth's ends and gives strength to our kings and will exalt the horn of his anointed."<verse eid="1SA 2:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:11"/>And they left him there before the Lord and departed to Harmathaim, and the lad was ministering to the face of the Lord, before Eli the priest.<verse eid="1SA 2:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:12"/>And the sons of Eli the priest were pestilent sons not knowing the Lord,<verse eid="1SA 2:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:13"/>and what was due to the priest from the people, when any was sacrificing, and the priest's servant would come, while the meat boiled, and a three-pronged meat hook in his hand,<verse eid="1SA 2:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:14"/>and he thrust it into the great cauldron or into the kettle or into the pot; all that came up on the meat hook the priest would take for himself. Like this they would do to all Israel who came to sacrifice to the Lord at Selom.<verse eid="1SA 2:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:15"/>And before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give meat for the priest to roast, and I will not accept from you boiled meat out of the cauldron."<verse eid="1SA 2:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:16"/>And the man who was sacrificing would say, "Let the fat be burned first as is proper, and take for yourself of all that your soul desires." And he said, "No, because you shall give it now, otherwise I will take it by force."<verse eid="1SA 2:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:17"/>And the sin of the boys before the Lord was very great, for they set at naught the offering of the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 2:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:18"/>And Samouel was ministering before the Lord, a boy wearing an ephoud bar<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:18</char><char closed="false" style="ft">MT = 'bad' = 'linen'</char></note>.<verse eid="1SA 2:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:19"/>And his mother made for him a small double cloak<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'double cloak':  a style of garment</char></note> and would bring it up to him from days to days<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'days to days':  I.e. 'time to time'</char></note> when she would go up with her husband to offer the <note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'yearly sacrifice'</char></note>sacrifice of the daysd.<verse eid="1SA 2:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:20"/>And Eli blessed Elkana and his wife, saying, "May the Lord repay you with offspring by this woman in return for the loan that you made to the Lord." And the man returned to his place.<verse eid="1SA 2:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:21"/>And the Lord took note of Hanna, and she bore further, three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samouel became great before the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 2:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:22"/>And Eli was a very old man, and he heard what his sons were doing to the sons of Israel,<verse eid="1SA 2:22"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:23"/>and he said to them, "Why do you do according to this thing which I hear from the mouth of all the people of the Lord?<verse eid="1SA 2:23"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:24"/>No, children, for the report which I hear is not good; do not behave in this way. For the reports that I hear are not good so that people are not subject to God.<verse eid="1SA 2:24"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:25"/>If in sinning a man sins against a man, and they shall pray for him to the Lord, and if he sins against the Lord, who shall pray for him?" And they would not listen to the voice of their father, for the Lord willfully willed to destroy them.<verse eid="1SA 2:25"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:26"/>And the boy Samouel kept going and became great and was in favor both with the Lord and with people.<verse eid="1SA 2:26"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:27"/>And a man of God came to Eli and said, "This is what the Lord says, 'When I revealed myself, I revealed myself to your father's house when they were in Egypt, slaves to the house of Pharao,<verse eid="1SA 2:27"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:28"/>and I chose the house of your father out of all the scepters of Israel, to serve me as priests and to go up on my altar and to offer incense and to bear an ephoud, and I gave to the house of your father all the things of the fire of the sons of Israel for food,<verse eid="1SA 2:28"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:29"/>and why did you look with greedy eye at my incense and my sacrifice and honored your sons above me, to bless themselves with the first fruit of every offering of Israel before me?'<verse eid="1SA 2:29"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:30"/>Therefore this is what the Lord the God of Israel has said: 'I said: Your family and your ancestral family shall go in and out before me forever,' but now, says the Lord: 'Far be it from me, for I will only honor those who honor me, and he who despises me shall be treated with contempt.<verse eid="1SA 2:30"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:31"/>Behold, days are coming, and I will destroy your offspring and the offspring of your father's house,<verse eid="1SA 2:31"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:32"/>and no elderly of yours will be in my house all the days,<verse eid="1SA 2:32"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:33"/>and a man I will not destroy for you from my altar so that his eyes may fail and his soul may ebb away, but every one that remains of your house-- they will fall by the sword of men.<verse eid="1SA 2:33"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:34"/>And this is the sign for you that will come upon these two sons of yours, Hophni and Phinees; both shall die on one day.<verse eid="1SA 2:34"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:35"/>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do all that is in my heart and that is in my soul, and I will build him a sure house, and he shall go about before my anointed one all the days.<verse eid="1SA 2:35"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 2:36"/>And it shall be; he who is left in your house shall come to do obeisance to him for a silver obol<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">2:36</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. a small coin</char></note>, saying, Put me down in one of your priestly places to eat bread."<verse eid="1SA 2:36"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:1"/>And the boy Samouel was ministering to the Lord before Eli the priest, and a word of the Lord was precious<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:1</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e. 'rare'</char></note> in those days; there was no distinguishing<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:1</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'distinct'</char></note> vision.<verse eid="1SA 3:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:2"/>And it happened in that day that Eli was lying down in his place, and his eyes began to be heavy, and he could not see,<verse eid="1SA 3:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:3"/>and it was before the lamp of God was replenished, and Samouel was lying down in the shrine, where the ark of God was,<verse eid="1SA 3:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:4"/>and the Lord called, "Samouel! Samouel!" And he said, "Here I am!"<verse eid="1SA 3:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:5"/>and ran to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you have called me," and he said, "I have not called you; return, lie down." And he returned and lay down.<verse eid="1SA 3:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:6"/>And the Lord continued and called, "Samouel! Samouel!" and he went to Eli the second time and said, "Here I am, for you have called me," and he said, "I have not called you; return, lie down."<verse eid="1SA 3:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:7"/>And it was before Samouel knew God and a word of the Lord had been revealed to him.<verse eid="1SA 3:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:8"/>And the Lord continued to call Samouel for a third time, and he got up and went to Eli and said, "Here I am, for you have called me." And Eli learned that the Lord had called the boy,<verse eid="1SA 3:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:9"/>and he said, "Return, lie down, my child, and it shall be that if he calls you, then you shall say, 'Speak, Lord, for your slave is listening.' " And Samouel went and lay down in his place.<verse eid="1SA 3:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:10"/>And the Lord came and stood and called him as once and once<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:10</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'once and once':  Probably 'before'</char></note>, and Samouel said, "Speak, for your slave is listening."<verse eid="1SA 3:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:11"/>And the Lord said to Samouel, "Behold, I carry out my words in Israel so that both ears of everyone that hears will tingle.<verse eid="1SA 3:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:12"/>On that day I will raise up against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house; I will begin, and I will finish.<verse eid="1SA 3:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:13"/>And I have told him that I am about to punish<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">3:13</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'avenge'</char></note> his house forever, for the iniquities of his sons, because his sons were reviling God, and even so he would not admonish them.<verse eid="1SA 3:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:14"/>I have sworn to the house of Eli, 'If the iniquity of Eli's house shall be expiated by incense or sacrifice forever ...' "<verse eid="1SA 3:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:15"/>And Samouel lay there until morning, and he arose early in the morning and opened the doors of the house of the Lord, and Samouel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.<verse eid="1SA 3:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:16"/>And Eli said to Samouel, "Samouel, my child," and he said, "Here I am."<verse eid="1SA 3:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:17"/>And he said, "What was the word that was told you? Nay, do not hide it from me; may God do thus to you and thus add, if you hide anything from me of all the words spoken to you in your ears."<verse eid="1SA 3:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:18"/>And Samouel reported all the words and hid not from him, and Eli said, "He is the Lord; he will do what is good before him."<verse eid="1SA 3:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:19"/>And Samouel became great, and the Lord was with him, and none of his words fell to the ground.<verse eid="1SA 3:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:20"/>And all Israel from Dan and as far as Bersabee knew that Samouel was faithful to the Lord as a prophet.<verse eid="1SA 3:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 3:21"/>And the Lord continued to appear at Selom, for the Lord had revealed himself to Samouel, and from one end of the land and as far as the other, Samouel was believed to be a prophet of the Lord to all Israel. And Eli was a very old man, and his sons kept advancing, and their way was evil before the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 3:21"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:1"/>And it happened in those days that the allophyles mustered for war against Israel, and Israel went out to meet them for war, and they encamped at Abenezer, and the allophyles encamped at Aphek.<verse eid="1SA 4:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:2"/>And the allophyles prepared for war against Israel, and the battle turned and a man of Israel fell before the allophyles, and four thousand men were smitten on the field in the battle.<verse eid="1SA 4:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:3"/>And the people came to the camp, and the elders of Israel said, "Why has the Lord caused us to fall today before allophyles? Let us take the ark of our God from Selom, and let it go out in our midst, and it will save us out of the hand of our enemies."<verse eid="1SA 4:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:4"/>And the people sent to Selom and brought from there the ark of the Lord who is seated on the cheroubim, and both sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinees, were with the ark.<verse eid="1SA 4:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:5"/>And it happened, when the ark of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, and the earth resounded.<verse eid="1SA 4:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:6"/>And the allophyles heard the shouting, and the allophyles said, "What is this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?" And they learned that the ark of the Lord had come into the camp.<verse eid="1SA 4:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:7"/>And the allophyles were afraid and said, "These are the gods that have come to them into the camp; woe to us, O Lord! Deliver us today, for nothing like this has happened yesterday or the third day.<verse eid="1SA 4:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:8"/>Woe to us! Who will deliver us out of the hand of these sturdy gods? These are the gods who struck Egypt with every plague, and in the wilderness.<verse eid="1SA 4:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:9"/>Strengthen yourselves and be men, O allophyles, lest you become subject to the Hebrews as they have been subject to us, and be men and fight them."<verse eid="1SA 4:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:10"/>And they fought them, and a man of Israel fell, and they fled each to his covert, and there was very great distress, and there fell of Israel thirty thousand from the units.<verse eid="1SA 4:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:11"/>And the ark of God was captured, and both sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinees, died.<verse eid="1SA 4:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:12"/>And a man, a Ieminite, ran from the battle line and came to Selom on that day, and his clothes were torn, and earth was upon his head.<verse eid="1SA 4:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:13"/>And he arrived, and behold, Eli was sitting upon the seat by the gate watching the road, for his heart was distraught for the ark of God, and the man came into the city to report the news, and the city cried out.<verse eid="1SA 4:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:14"/>And Eli heard the sound of the cry and said, "What is the cry of this sound? And the man, hurrying, entered in and told Eli.<verse eid="1SA 4:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:15"/>And Eli was a son of ninety years, and his eyes were set<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:15</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'swollen'</char></note>, and he could not see, and Eli said to the men standing about him, "What is the sound of this noise?"<verse eid="1SA 4:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:16"/>And hurrying the man came to Eli and said to him, "I am the one who has come from the camp, and I have fled from the battle today." And he said, "What has happened, child?"<verse eid="1SA 4:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:17"/>And the lad answered and said, "A<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">4:17</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Possibly 'every'</char></note> man of Israel has fled before the allophyles, and there has also been a great slaughter among the people, and both your sons are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."<verse eid="1SA 4:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:18"/>And it happened, when he mentioned the ark of God, he fell over backward from the seat near the gate, and his back was broken, and he died, for the man was old and heavy, and he had judged Israel twenty years.<verse eid="1SA 4:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:19"/>And his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinees, was pregnant to give birth, and she heard the news that the ark of God was captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, and she crouched down and gave birth, for her labor pains came upon her.<verse eid="1SA 4:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:20"/>And as she was about to die, the women attending her said to her, "Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son," and she did not answer, and her heart did not give heed.<verse eid="1SA 4:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:21"/>And she named the boy Woe Barchaboth, because of the ark of God and because of her father-in-law and because of her husband.<verse eid="1SA 4:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 4:22"/>And they said, "The glory of Israel has been exiled, in that the ark of the Lord has been taken."<verse eid="1SA 4:22"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:1"/>And the allophyles took the ark of God and brought it from Abennezer to Azotus.<verse eid="1SA 5:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:2"/>And the allophyles took the ark of the Lord and brought it into the house of Dagon and placed it beside Dagon.<verse eid="1SA 5:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:3"/>And the Azotians rose early and entered into the house of Dagon and looked and behold, Dagon fallen on his face before the ark of God. And they raised up Dagon and put him back in his place. And the hand of the Lord was heavy on the Azotians, and he plagued them and afflicted them on their seats, Azotus and its borders.<verse eid="1SA 5:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:4"/>And it happened, when they rose early on the next morning, that, behold, Dagon fallen on his face before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and the head of Dagon and both soles of his hands cut off, each on the front parts of amapheth<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">5:4</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'threshold'</char></note>, and both wrists of his hands fallen in the doorway; only the spine of Dagon was left.<verse eid="1SA 5:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:5"/>This is why the priests of Dagon and anyone who enters the house of Dagon do not step on the step of the house of Dagon in Azotus to this day, for when they step over, they step over.<verse eid="1SA 5:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:6"/>And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon Azotus and brought trouble on them, and it broke out upon them into the ships, and in the midst of its territory mice grew up, and there was great confusion of death in the city.<verse eid="1SA 5:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:7"/>And the men of Azotus saw that it was so, and they said, "The ark of the God of Israel shall not sit with us, for his hand is harsh on us and on our god Dagon."<verse eid="1SA 5:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:8"/>And they sent and gathered together to them the satraps of the allophyles and said, "What should we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" And the Geththites said, "Let the ark of God come over to us," and the ark of God came over to Geththa.<verse eid="1SA 5:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:9"/>And it happened, after it came over, that the hand of the Lord came on the city, a very great disturbance, and smote the men of the city from small to great and smote them on their seats, and the Geththites made for themselves seats.<verse eid="1SA 5:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:10"/>And they sent away the ark of God to Ascalon, and it happened, when the ark of God entered Ascalon, that the Ascalonites cried out, saying, "Why have you brought back to us the ark of the God of Israel to put us to death and our people?"<verse eid="1SA 5:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:11"/>And they sent and gathered together the satraps of the allophyles and said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it lodge in its own place, and it shall not put us and our people to death"; for there was a very heavy confusion of death in the whole city when the ark of the God of Israel entered there,<verse eid="1SA 5:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 5:12"/>and those who lived and did not die were stricken on the seats, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.<verse eid="1SA 5:12"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:1"/>And the ark was in the country of the allophyles seven months, and their land broke out in mice.<verse eid="1SA 6:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:2"/>And the allophyles called for the priests and the diviners and their enchanters, saying, "What should we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us in what we should send it to its place."<verse eid="1SA 6:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:3"/>And they said, "If you are sending away the ark of the covenant of the Lord, God of Israel, on no account send it away empty, but in giving it back give back for it something of the torment, and then you will be healed, and it will propitiate for you, lest his hand not withdraw from you."<verse eid="1SA 6:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:4"/>And they said, "What is that something of the torment that we should render for it?" And they said, "Five gold seats, according to the number of the satraps of the allophyles, because you and your rulers and the people have one offense,<verse eid="1SA 6:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:5"/>and a gold mouse a likeness of your mice that ravage the land, and you shall give glory to the Lord, that he might lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your land.<verse eid="1SA 6:5"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 6:10"/>And the allophyles did so and took two cows that had calved for the first time and yoked them to the cart and kept back their young at home,<verse eid="1SA 6:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:11"/>and they put the ark on the cart and the deposit as ergab<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">6:11</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'argaz' = 'box'</char></note> and the gold mice.<verse eid="1SA 6:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:12"/>And the cows went straight on the way to the way of Baithsamys; they kept going on one path and kept toiling and did not turn aside to the right or the left, and the satraps of the allophyles kept going behind it as far as the borders of Baithsamys.<verse eid="1SA 6:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:13"/>And the people of Baithsamys were reaping the wheat harvest in the valley, and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark of the Lord and rejoiced to meet it.<verse eid="1SA 6:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:14"/>And the cart came into the field of Hosee which was in Baithsamys, and they set up there beside it a great stone, and they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a whole burnt offering to the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 6:14"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 6:16"/>And the five satraps of the allophyles were watching, and they returned on that day to Ascalon.<verse eid="1SA 6:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:17"/>And these are the gold seats which the allophyles returned to the Lord for the torment: one for Azotus, one for Gaza, one for Ascalon, one for Geth, one for Akkaron--<verse eid="1SA 6:17"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 6:19"/>And the sons of Iechonias were not pleased with the men of Baithsamys, because they saw the ark of the Lord, and he smote among them seventy men and fifty thousand men.

    <verse sid="1SA 6:20"/>And the men who were from Baithsamys said, "Who shall be able to pass before this holy Lord? And to whom shall the ark of the Lord go up from us?"<verse eid="1SA 6:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 6:21"/>And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kariathiarim, saying, "The allophyles returned the ark of the Lord; come down, and take it up to yourselves."<verse eid="1SA 6:21"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:1"/>And the men of Kariathiarim came and brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord and brought it in to the house of Aminadab, which was on the hill, and they consecrated his son, Eleazar, to have charge of the ark of the covenant of the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 7:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:2"/>And it happened, from the day the ark was at Kariathiarim, that the days multiplied, and it was twenty years, and all the house of Israel looked back after the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 7:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:3"/>And Samouel said to all the house of Israel, saying, "If you are returning to the Lord with all your heart, take away the foreign gods and the groves from among you, and prepare your hearts towards the Lord, and be subject to him alone, and he will deliver you out of the hand of allophyles."<verse eid="1SA 7:3"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 7:5"/>And Samouel said, "Gather all Israel at Massephath, and I will pray to the Lord for you."<verse eid="1SA 7:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:6"/>And they were brought together at Massephath, and they drew water and poured it out on the ground before the Lord, and they fasted in that day and said, "We have sinned before the Lord." And Samouel was judging the sons of Israel at Massephath.<verse eid="1SA 7:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:7"/>And the allophyles heard that all the sons of Israel had been gathered together at Massephath, and the satraps of the allophyles went up against Israel, and the sons of Israel heard and were afraid from before the allophyles.<verse eid="1SA 7:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:8"/>And the sons of Israel said to Samouel, "Do not omit mention of us so as not to cry to the Lord, your God, and he will save us out of the hand of the allophyles."<verse eid="1SA 7:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:9"/>And Samouel took one sucking lamb and offered it with all the people as a whole burnt offering to the Lord, and Samouel cried out to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord heard him.<verse eid="1SA 7:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:10"/>And Samouel was offering up the whole burnt offering, and the allophyles drew near for war against Israel. And the Lord thundered with a mighty voice in that day against the allophyles, and they were thrown into confusion and fell before Israel.<verse eid="1SA 7:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:11"/>And the men of Israel went out of Massephath and pursued the allophyles and struck them down as far as under Baithchor.<verse eid="1SA 7:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:12"/>And Samouel took one stone and set it up between Massephath and between the old city and called its name Abenezer, Stone of the Helper, and he said, "Thus far the Lord has helped us."<verse eid="1SA 7:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:13"/>And the Lord humbled the allophyles, and they did not add again to enter into the territory of Israel, and the hand of the Lord was against the allophyles all the days of Samouel.<verse eid="1SA 7:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:14"/>And the towns that the allophyles took from the sons of Israel were restored, and they restored them to Israel from Ascalon to Azob, and Israel recovered the territory from the hand of the allophyles. And there was peace between Israel and between the Amorrite.<verse eid="1SA 7:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 7:15"/>And Samouel was judging Israel all the days of his life,<verse eid="1SA 7:15"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 7:17"/>But his return was to Harmathaim, for his home was there, and he was judging Israel there, and he built there an altar to the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 7:17"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:1"/>And it happened, when Samouel became old, that he appointed his sons judges over Israel.<verse eid="1SA 8:1"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 8:4"/>And the men of Israel gathered together and came to Harmathaim to Samouel<verse eid="1SA 8:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:5"/>and said to him, "You are old, and your sons do not go in your way, and now appoint over us a king to judge us just like the rest of the nations."<verse eid="1SA 8:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:6"/>And the message was evil in the eyes of Samouel when they said, "Give us a king to judge us," and Samouel prayed to the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 8:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:7"/>And the Lord said to Samouel, "Listen to the voice of the people in whatever they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.<verse eid="1SA 8:7"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 8:10"/>And Samouel told every word of the Lord to the people who were requesting a king of him.<verse eid="1SA 8:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:11"/>And he said, "This will be the just claim of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and put them in his chariots and for his cavalry, and those running before his chariots,<verse eid="1SA 8:11"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 8:16"/>and he will take your male and female slaves and your good cattle and your donkeys and will take one tenth for his works,<verse eid="1SA 8:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:17"/>and he will take one-tenth of your flocks, and you shall be slaves to him.<verse eid="1SA 8:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:18"/>And in that day you will cry out from before your king whom you chose for yourselves, and the Lord will not hear you in those days, because you chose a king for yourselves."<verse eid="1SA 8:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:19"/>And the people did not want to listen to Samouel and said to him, "No! But a king will be over us,<verse eid="1SA 8:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:20"/>and we too will be like all the nations, and our king will judge us and will go out before us and fight our battle."<verse eid="1SA 8:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:21"/>And Samouel heard all the words of the people and spoke them in the ears of the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 8:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 8:22"/>And the Lord said to Samouel, "Listen to their voice, and appoint for them a king." And Samouel said to the men of Israel, "Let each return to his town."<verse eid="1SA 8:22"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:1"/>And there was a man of the sons of Beniamin, and his name was Kis son of Abiel son of Sared son of Bachir son of Aphek son of a Ieminite man, a mighty man.<verse eid="1SA 9:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:2"/>And this man had a son, and his name was Saoul, tall, a good man, and there was not among the sons of Israel better than he; above the shoulder and upward he was taller than all the land.<verse eid="1SA 9:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:3"/>And the donkeys of Kis, Saoul's father, strayed, and Kis said to his son Saoul, "Take one of the lads with yourself, and arise, and go, and look for the donkeys."<verse eid="1SA 9:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:4"/>And they passed through the hill country of Ephraim and passed through the land of Selcha and did not find them, and they passed through the land of Easakem, and there was nothing, and they passed through the land of Iakim and did not find them.<verse eid="1SA 9:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:5"/>When they came to Siph, then Saoul said to his lad who was with him, "Come, and let us turn back, lest when my father leaves the donkeys he should be anxious about us."<verse eid="1SA 9:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:6"/>And the lad said to him, "Behold, now a man of God is in this town, and the man is held in honor; anything, whatever he says, when it comes, it will happen, and now let us go, that he might tell us our journey on which we have set out on it."<verse eid="1SA 9:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:7"/>And Saoul said to his lad who was with him, "And behold, we will go, and what shall we bring the man of God? For the bread in our containers is used up, and there is nothing more that belongs to us to bring to the man of God."<verse eid="1SA 9:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:8"/>And the lad added to answer Saoul and said, "Behold, a quarter of a shekel of silver is found in my hand, and you will give it to the man of God, and he will tell us our way"<verse eid="1SA 9:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:9"/>(And formerly in Israel everyone when going to inquire of God would say this, "Come, let us go to the seer," for formerly the people used to call the prophet, "the seer.")<verse eid="1SA 9:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:10"/>And Saoul said to his lad, "The matter is good; come and let us go." And they went to the town, there where the man of God was.<verse eid="1SA 9:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:11"/>As they were going up the ascent to the town, then they found the girls when they had come out to draw water and said to them, "Is the seer here?"<verse eid="1SA 9:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:12"/>And the girls answered them and said to them, "He is, behold, ahead of you! He has come because of the day to the town, because the people have a sacrifice today at Bama;<verse eid="1SA 9:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:13"/>as soon as you enter the town, thus you will find him in the town before he goes up to Bama to eat, for the people will not eat until he enters, because he blesses the sacrifice, and after these things the guests eat, and now go up, for because of the day you will find him."<verse eid="1SA 9:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:14"/>And they went up to the town. As they were entering into the center of the town then, behold, Samouel came to meet them to go up to Bama.<verse eid="1SA 9:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:15"/>And one day before Saoul came to him, the Lord uncovered Samouel's ear, saying:<verse eid="1SA 9:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:16"/>"Tomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from the land of Beniamin, and you shall anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel, and he shall save my people from the hand of allophyles; for I have looked upon the humiliation of my people, because their cry has come to me."<verse eid="1SA 9:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:17"/>And Samouel saw Saoul, and the Lord answered him, "Behold, the man about whom I said to you, 'This one shall rule among my people.' "<verse eid="1SA 9:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:18"/>And Saoul approached Samouel in the center of the town and said, "Tell, now, which is the house of the seer?"<verse eid="1SA 9:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:19"/>And Samouel answered Saoul and said: "I am he; go up before me to Bama, and eat with me today, and in the morning I will send you off and will tell you all that is in your heart.<verse eid="1SA 9:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:20"/>And as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your heart on them, for they have been found, and whose is the beauty of Israel? Is it not yours and your ancestral house?"<verse eid="1SA 9:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:21"/>And Saoul answered and said, "Am I not son of a Ieminite man, the small scepter of a tribe of Israel and of the least tribe of the whole scepter of Beniamin? And why did you speak to me according to this word?"<verse eid="1SA 9:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:22"/>And Samouel took Saoul and his lad and brought them into the lodging place and set a place for them among the first of those who had been invited-- about seventy men.<verse eid="1SA 9:22"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:23"/>And Samouel said to the cook, "Give me the portion that I gave you, the one I told you to put aside."<verse eid="1SA 9:23"/>

And Saoul ate with Samouel in that day.<verse eid="1SA 9:24"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:25"/>And he came down from Bama into the town, and they spread a bed for Saoul on the roof,<verse eid="1SA 9:25"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:26"/>and he fell asleep. And it happened when dawn arose that Samouel called Saoul on the roof, saying, "Get up, and I will send you on your way," and Saoul got up, and he and Samouel went out, outside.<verse eid="1SA 9:26"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 9:27"/>As they were going down to the outskirts of the town, Samouel said to Saoul, "Speak to the young man, and let him go on before us, and as for you, stand as today, and hear a message from God."<verse eid="1SA 9:27"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 15:21"/>and from the spoils the people took flocks and herds, the first of the things devoted to destruction, to sacrifice before the Lord, our God, in Galgala."<verse eid="1SA 15:21"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 17:39"/>and he girded Dauid with his sword over his woolen cloak, and he grew tired walking once and twice. And Dauid said to Saoul, "I shall definitely not be able to go in these, for I am not experienced." And they removed them from him.<verse eid="1SA 17:39"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 17:40"/>And he took his staff in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the wadi and put them in his shepherd's bag, which he had with him for collecting, and his sling in his hand, and he advanced against the man, the allophyle.<verse eid="1SA 17:40"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 17:42"/>And Goliad saw Dauid, and he disdained him, for he was a boy, and he was ruddy with beauty of eyes.<verse eid="1SA 17:42"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 17:43"/>And the allophyle said to Dauid, "Am I like a dog, that you come upon me with a rod and stones?" And Dauid said, "No, but worse than a dog." And the allophyle cursed Dauid by his gods.<verse eid="1SA 17:43"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 17:44"/>And the allophyle said to Dauid, "Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and to the animals of the earth."<verse eid="1SA 17:44"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 17:45"/>And Dauid said to the allophyle, "You come to me with sword and with spear and with shield, and I am coming to you in the name of the Lord Sabaoth, the God of the ranks of Israel, which you have reproached today.<verse eid="1SA 17:45"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 17:46"/>And today the Lord will shut you up into my hand, and I will kill you and remove your head from you, and I will give your limbs and the limbs of the camp of the allophyles on this day to the birds of the air and to the wild animals of the earth, and all the earth will know that there is a God in Israel,<verse eid="1SA 17:46"/>

  <chapter sid="1SA 19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:1"/>And Saoul spoke to his son Ionathan and to all his servants to put Dauid to death. And Saoul's son Ionathan was much taken with Dauid.<verse eid="1SA 19:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:2"/>And Ionathan told Dauid, saying, "Saoul seeks to put you to death; therefore be on guard tomorrow morning, and hide yourself, and stay in hiding,<verse eid="1SA 19:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:3"/>and I will go out and stand beside my father in a field, there where you are, and I will speak to my father about you and see what it might be, and I will tell you."<verse eid="1SA 19:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:4"/>And Ionathan spoke well of Dauid to his father Saoul and said to him, "Let the king not sin against your slave Dauid, because he has not sinned against you, and his deeds are very good,<verse eid="1SA 19:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:5"/>and he put his life in his hand and smote the allophyle, and the Lord brought about a great deliverance, and all Israel saw and rejoiced, and why do you sin against innocent blood by putting Dauid to death without cause?"<verse eid="1SA 19:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:6"/>And Saoul heeded the voice of Ionathan, and Saoul swore, saying, "The Lord lives, if he shall die!"<verse eid="1SA 19:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:7"/>And Ionathan called Dauid and related all these words to him, and Ionathan brought Dauid in to Saoul, and he was in his presence as yesterday and the third day.<verse eid="1SA 19:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:8"/>And the war continued to be against Saoul, and Dauid prevailed over and fought the allophyles, and he smote among them with a very great blow, and they fled from before him.<verse eid="1SA 19:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:9"/>And there came an evil divine spirit upon Saoul, and he was at rest in his house, and a spear was in his hand, and Dauid was playing music with his hands,<verse eid="1SA 19:9"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 19:11"/>And it happened in that night that Saoul sent messengers to Dauid's house to keep watch over him to put him to death in the morning.

    <verse sid="1SA 19:12"/>And Melchol let Dauid down through the window, and he departed and flew away and escaped.<verse eid="1SA 19:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:13"/>And Melchol took and laid the cenotaph on the bed, and she put goats' liver by its head and covered them with a garment.<verse eid="1SA 19:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:14"/>And Saoul sent messengers to take Dauid, and they said he was unwell.<verse eid="1SA 19:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:15"/>And he sent for Dauid, saying, "Bring him to me on the bed, that I may put him to death."<verse eid="1SA 19:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:16"/>And the messengers come, and behold, the cenotaph is on the bed, and goats' liver by its head.<verse eid="1SA 19:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:17"/>And Saoul said to Melchol, "Why have you thus deceived me and sent off my enemy, and he has escaped?" And Melchol said to Saoul, "He said, 'Send me off, but if not, I will put you to death.' "<verse eid="1SA 19:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:18"/>And Dauid fled and escaped and came to Samouel at Harmathaim and told him all that Saoul did to him, and Dauid and Samouel went and settled at Nauath in Rama.<verse eid="1SA 19:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:19"/>And it was told to Saoul, saying, "Behold, Dauid is at Nauath in Rama."<verse eid="1SA 19:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:20"/>And Saoul sent messengers to take Dauid, and they saw the assembly of the prophets, and Samouel stood as appointed over them, and a divine spirit came upon the messengers of Saoul, and they were prophesying.<verse eid="1SA 19:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:21"/>And it was told to Saoul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saoul added to send messengers the third time, and they too prophesied.<verse eid="1SA 19:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:22"/>And Saoul was seething with anger, and he too went to Harmathaim, and he came to the well of the threshing floor that is in Sephi, and he asked and said, "Where are Samouel and Dauid?" And they said, "Behold, at Nauath in Rama."<verse eid="1SA 19:22"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:23"/>And he went from there toward Nauath in Rama, and a divine spirit also came upon him, and as he was going, he was prophesying until he came to Nauath in Rama.<verse eid="1SA 19:23"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 19:24"/>And he stripped off his clothes, and he prophesied before them and fell naked all that day and the whole night. Therefore they were saying, "Is Saoul also among the prophets?"<verse eid="1SA 19:24"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:1"/>And Dauid fled from Nauath in Rama and came before Ionathan and said, "What have I done? And what is my wrong? And wherein have I sinned before your father that he is seeking my life?"<verse eid="1SA 20:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:2"/>And Ionathan said to him, "Far be it from you! You shall not die. Behold, my father will not do anything either great or small and not uncover my ear, and why is it that my father should hide this matter? This is not possible!"<verse eid="1SA 20:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:3"/>And Dauid answered Ionathan and said, "Perceiving your father knows that I have found favor in your eyes, and he said, 'Do not let Ionathan know this; he may not consent.' But, the Lord lives, and your soul lives, that, as I said, between me and death has been filled up."<verse eid="1SA 20:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:4"/>And Ionathan said to Dauid, "What does your soul desire, and what shall I do for you?"<verse eid="1SA 20:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:5"/>And Dauid said to Ionathan, "Behold, now, tomorrow is the new moon and seated I will not sit with the king to eat, and you will send me off, and I will hide in the plain until evening.<verse eid="1SA 20:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:6"/>If observing your father observes me, then you will say, 'Entreating Dauid asked leave of me to run as far as to Bethleem his city, for there is a sacrifice of days there for all the tribe.'<verse eid="1SA 20:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:7"/>If this is what he says, 'Very well!' there is peace for your slave, and if he should answer you harshly, know that evil has been determined by him.<verse eid="1SA 20:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:8"/>And you shall do mercy with your slave, for you have brought your slave into a covenant with the Lord along with yourself, and if there is iniquity in your slave, you put me to death, and why should you bring me thus to your father?"<verse eid="1SA 20:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:9"/>And Ionathan said, "Far be it from you, for if knowing I know that the evil from my father had been determined to come upon you-- and if not-- I will bring tidings to you to your cities."<verse eid="1SA 20:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:10"/>And Dauid said to Ionathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"<verse eid="1SA 20:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:11"/>And Ionathan said to Dauid, "Go, and stay in a field." And they both went out into a field.<verse eid="1SA 20:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:12"/>And Ionathan said to Dauid, "The Lord the God of Israel knows that I will sound out my father as the opportunity arises, three times, and behold, if there is good concerning Dauid, then I will not send to you in the field;<verse eid="1SA 20:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:13"/>this is what God may do to Ionathan, and this is what he may add, for I will report the evils to you and uncover your ear and I will send you off, and you will depart in peace, and the Lord will be with you as he was with my father.<verse eid="1SA 20:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:14"/>And if I am still living, you shall also do mercy with me, and if I die by death,<verse eid="1SA 20:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:15"/>you shall not remove your mercy from my house for ever, and if not, when the Lord removes the enemies of Dauid, each from the face of the earth,<verse eid="1SA 20:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:16"/>that the name of Ionathan be removed from the house of Dauid, and may the Lord seek out the enemies of Dauid."<verse eid="1SA 20:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:17"/>And Ionathan added yet to swear to Dauid, for he loved the soul of one who loved him.<verse eid="1SA 20:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:18"/>And Ionathan said, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be observed, because your seat will be observed.<verse eid="1SA 20:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:19"/>And you shall do it three times and observe and come to your place where you hid on the workday, and you will sit by that ergab<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">20:19</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'argaz' = 'box' (MT other)</char></note>.<verse eid="1SA 20:19"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 20:21"/>And behold, I will send the lad, saying, 'Go, find the dart for me.' If I say to the lad, saying, 'Here is the dart, away from you, even here; take it'; come, for, the Lord lives, there is peace for you, and there is no word.<verse eid="1SA 20:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:22"/>If this is what I say to the young man, 'Here is the dart, away from you, even beyond'; go, for the Lord has sent you away.<verse eid="1SA 20:22"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 20:24"/>And Dauid hid in a field, and the month came, and the king came to the table to eat.<verse eid="1SA 20:24"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:25"/>And the king sat upon his seat, as once and again, upon the seat by a wall. And he preceded Ionathan, and Abenner sat beside Saoul, and Dauid's place was under observation.<verse eid="1SA 20:25"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:26"/>And Saoul did not say anything in that day, for he said, "A chance; he appears not to be clean because he has not purified himself."<verse eid="1SA 20:26"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:27"/>And it happened on the morrow, on the second day of the month, and Dauid's place was under observation. And Saoul said to his son Ionathan, "Why is it that the son of Iessai has not come to the table, both yesterday and today?"<verse eid="1SA 20:27"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:28"/>And Ionathan answered Saoul and said to him, "Dauid asked leave of me to go as far as to Bethleem his city,<verse eid="1SA 20:28"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:29"/>and he said, 'Do send me off, for there is a sacrifice of our tribe for us in the city, and my brothers gave orders to me, and now, if I have found favor in your eyes, I will indeed get away and see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table."<verse eid="1SA 20:29"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:30"/>And Saoul was greatly seething with anger against Ionathan, and he said to him, "You son of traitorous girls! For do I not know that you are an accomplice of the son of Iessai to your shame and to the shame of your mother's uncovering?<verse eid="1SA 20:30"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:31"/>For during all the days which the son of Iessai lives upon the earth, your kingdom shall not be established. Now therefore send, take the youth, for he is a son of death."<verse eid="1SA 20:31"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:32"/>And Ionathan answered Saoul, "Why does he die? What has he done?"<verse eid="1SA 20:32"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:33"/>And Saoul lifted up the spear against Ionathan, to put him to death, and Ionathan knew that this evil from his father to put Dauid to death was fully determined,<verse eid="1SA 20:33"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:34"/>and Ionathan sprang up from the table in fierce anger and ate no food on the second day of the month, for he was grieved for Dauid, because his father was set against him.<verse eid="1SA 20:34"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:35"/>And morning came, and Ionathan went out into the field as arranged for a witness to Dauid, and with him was a little boy.<verse eid="1SA 20:35"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:36"/>And he said to the boy, "Run, find for me the darts with which I am throwing." And the boy ran, and he was throwing the dart and sent it beyond.<verse eid="1SA 20:36"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:37"/>And the boy came to the place of the dart where Ionathan was throwing, and Ionathan called after the young man and said, "There is the dart, away from you, even beyond."<verse eid="1SA 20:37"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:38"/>And Ionathan called after his boy saying, "Hurrying, be quick, and do not linger." And Ionathan's boy gathered up the darts for his master.<verse eid="1SA 20:38"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 20:39"/>And the boy knew nothing; only Ionathan and Dauid knew the matter.<verse eid="1SA 20:39"/>

  <chapter sid="1SA 21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:1"/>(20.42b) And Dauid got up and left, and Ionathan went into the city.<verse eid="1SA 21:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:2"/>(21.1) And Dauid came to Nomba to the priest Abimelech. And Abimelech was astonished to meet him and said to him, "Why is it that you are alone, and no one with you?"<verse eid="1SA 21:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:3"/>(2) And Dauid said to the priest, "The king has charged me with a matter today and said to me, 'Let no one know the matter about which I send you and concerning which I have charged you,' and I have testified solemnly to the lads in the place called Faith of God, Phellani, Alemoni,<verse eid="1SA 21:3"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 21:6"/>(5) And Dauid answered the priest and said to him, "Indeed we have kept ourselves from a woman yesterday and the third day; when I go on a journey all the lads have become consecrated, and this journey is profane<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">21:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="1SA 21:8"/>(7) And one of the lads of Saoul was there in that day detained neessaran<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">21:8</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew = 'detained'</char></note> before the Lord, and his name was Doek the Syrian, tending Saoul's mules.<verse eid="1SA 21:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:9"/>(8) And Dauid said to Abimelech, "See if there is a spear or sword here by your hand, for I have not brought my sword and my implements in my hand, because the king's business was in haste."<verse eid="1SA 21:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:10"/>(9) And the priest said, "Behold, the sword of Goliath the allophyle whom you killed in the valley of Ela, and it is wrapped in a garment; if you will take this for yourself, take it, for there is none here except this one." And Dauid said, "Behold, there is none like it; give it to me."<verse eid="1SA 21:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:11"/>And he gave it to him.(10) And Dauid rose and fled in that day from before Saoul. And Dauid went to King Anchous of Geth.<verse eid="1SA 21:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:12"/>(11) And the servants of Anchous said to him, "Is this not Dauid, the king of the land? Did the dancers not take the lead for this one, saying, 'Saoul killed amongst his thousands, and Dauid amongst his ten thousands'?"<verse eid="1SA 21:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:13"/>(12) And Dauid put the words in his heart and was very much afraid from before King Anchous of Geth.<verse eid="1SA 21:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:14"/>(13) And he changed his face before him, and he put on an act in that day, and he drummed on the doors of the city and gestured with his hands and fell against the doors of the gate, and his spittle ran down on his beard.<verse eid="1SA 21:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:15"/>(14) And Anchous said to his servants, "Look, see an epileptic man; why did you bring him to me?<verse eid="1SA 21:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 21:16"/>(15) Indeed, do I lack epileptics, that you have brought him to have an epileptic fit before me? This fellow shall not come into the house."<verse eid="1SA 21:16"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 22"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:1"/>And Dauid left there and escaped and came to the Odollam cave. And his brothers and his father's house heard and went down there to him.<verse eid="1SA 22:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:2"/>And every one in distress and every one in debt and every one troubled in soul were gathering to him, and he was leader over them, and there were with him about four hundred men.<verse eid="1SA 22:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:3"/>And Dauid went from there to Massepha of Moab and said to the king of Moab, "Let now my father and my mother be with you until I know what God will do for me."<verse eid="1SA 22:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:4"/>And he persuaded the person of the king of Moab, and they were dwelling with him all the days that Dauid was in the stronghold.<verse eid="1SA 22:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:5"/>And the prophet Gad said to Dauid, "Do not remain in the stronghold; leave, and you shall enter into the land of Ioudas." And Dauid left and went and settled in the city of Sarich.<verse eid="1SA 22:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:6"/>And Saoul heard that Dauid had been recognized, and the men who were with him, and Saoul was sitting on the hill below the cultivated field which is in Rama, and his spear in his hand, and all his servants stood around him.<verse eid="1SA 22:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:7"/>And Saoul said to his servants who stood around him and said to them, "Do hear, sons of Beniamin, if the son of Iessai will truly give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all officers of hundreds and officers of thousands!<verse eid="1SA 22:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:8"/>For you are all in collusion against me, and there is no one who uncovers my ear when my son makes a covenant with the son of Iessai, and there is no one of you who feels sorry for me or uncovers my ear because my son stirred up my slave against me as an enemy, as this day."<verse eid="1SA 22:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:9"/>And Doek the Syrian who was in charge of Saoul's mules answered and said, "I have seen the son of Iessai coming to Nomba to Abimelech son of Achitob the priest,<verse eid="1SA 22:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:10"/>and he was inquiring of God for him, and he gave him provisions and gave him the sword of Goliad the allophyle."<verse eid="1SA 22:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:11"/>And the king sent to call Abimelech son of Achitob and all the sons of his father, the priests who were at Nomba, and all of them came to the king.<verse eid="1SA 22:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:12"/>And Saoul said, "Listen now, son of Achitob." And he said, "Here I am, speak, sir."<verse eid="1SA 22:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:13"/>And Saoul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Iessai, that you gave him bread and a sword and that you ask through God for him, to set him against me as an enemy, as this day?"<verse eid="1SA 22:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:14"/>And he answered the king and said, "And who among all your slaves is like Dauid, faithful and the king's son-in-law and executor of your every behest and honored in your house?<verse eid="1SA 22:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:15"/>Have I begun today to ask through God for him? By no means! Let not the king impute anything to his slave or to the whole of my father's house, for your slave knew nothing of all this, a matter small or large."<verse eid="1SA 22:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:16"/>And Saoul the king said, "You shall die by death, Abimelech, you and all your father's house."<verse eid="1SA 22:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:17"/>And the king said to the runners who stood around him, "Draw near, and put to death the priests of the Lord, because their hand is with Dauid and because they knew that he was fleeing and they did not uncover my ear." And the servants of the king were not willing to extend their hands to attack the priests of the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 22:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:18"/>And the king said to Doek, "You, turn, and attack the priests." And Doek the Syrian turned and put to death the priests of the Lord in that day, three hundred five men, all bearing an ephoud.<verse eid="1SA 22:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:19"/>And Nomba, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword: from man up to woman, from child up to infant, and calf and donkey and sheep.<verse eid="1SA 22:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:20"/>And one son of Abimelech son of Achitob escaped, and his name was Abiathar, and he fled after Dauid.<verse eid="1SA 22:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:21"/>And Abiathar told Dauid that Saoul put to death all the priests of the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 22:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:22"/>And Dauid said to Abiathar, "I knew in that day that Doek the Syrian-- that telling he would tell Saoul. I am responsible for the lives of your father's house.<verse eid="1SA 22:22"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 22:23"/>Stay with me; do not be afraid; for where I shall seek a place for my life, I shall also seek one for your life, for you are safe with me."<verse eid="1SA 22:23"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 23"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:1"/>And it was told to Dauid, saying, "Behold, the allophyles are fighting in Keila, and they are despoiling, they are trampling the threshing floors."<verse eid="1SA 23:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:2"/>And Dauid inquired through the Lord, saying, "Shall I go and attack these allophyles?" And the Lord said, "Go, and you shall attack among these allophyles and rescue Keila."<verse eid="1SA 23:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:3"/>And Dauid's men said to him, "Behold, we are afraid here in Judea, and how will it be if we go to Keila? We shall enter into the spoils of the allophyles."<verse eid="1SA 23:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:4"/>And Dauid added to inquire again through the Lord, and the Lord answered him and said to him, "Arise, and go down to Keila, for I am giving the allophyles into your hands."<verse eid="1SA 23:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:5"/>And Dauid went, and the men who were with him, to Keila and fought with the allophyles, and they fled from before him, and he brought away their livestock and dealt a heavy blow among them. And Dauid rescued the inhabitants of Keila.<verse eid="1SA 23:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:6"/>And it happened, when Abiathar son of Abimelech fled to Dauid, that he came down with Dauid to Keila having an ephoud in his hand.<verse eid="1SA 23:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:7"/>And it was told Saoul that Dauid had come to Keila, and Saoul said, "God has sold him into my hands, for he has shut himself in having entered a town of doors and bars."<verse eid="1SA 23:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:8"/>And Saoul summoned all the people to war to go down to Keila to besiege Dauid and his men.<verse eid="1SA 23:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:9"/>And Dauid learned that Saoul was not keeping the evil concerning him quiet, and Dauid said to the priest Abiathar, "Bring the ephoud of the Lord here."<verse eid="1SA 23:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:10"/>And Dauid said, "O Lord, the God of Israel, hearing your slave has heard that Saoul seeks to come to Keila to destroy the city on my account.<verse eid="1SA 23:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:11"/>Will it be shut up? And now, will Saoul come down as your slave has heard? O Lord, the God of Israel, tell your slave." And the Lord said, "It will be shut up."<verse eid="1SA 23:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:12"/><verse eid="1SA 23:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:13"/>And Dauid arose, and the men who were with him, about four hundred, and they departed from Keila, and they were going wherever they went, and it was told Saoul that Dauid had escaped from Keila, and he gave up to go out.<verse eid="1SA 23:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:14"/>And Dauid settled in the wilderness in Maserem at the narrows, and he sat in the wilderness in Mount Ziph in the dry country, and Saoul was seeking him all the days, and the Lord did not give him into his hands.<verse eid="1SA 23:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:15"/>And Dauid saw that Saoul was coming out to seek Dauid, and Dauid was in the dry mountain in New Ziph.<verse eid="1SA 23:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:16"/>And Saoul's son Ionathan set out and came to Dauid at New and strengthened his hands in the Lord.<verse eid="1SA 23:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:17"/>And he said to him, "Do not be afraid, for the hand of my father Saoul shall not find you, and you shall be king over Israel, and I shall be second to you, and my father Saoul knows that this is so."<verse eid="1SA 23:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:18"/>And both of them made a covenant before the Lord, and Dauid sat at New, and Ionathan departed to his house.<verse eid="1SA 23:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:19"/>And the Ziphites from the dry country went up to Saoul on the hill, saying, "Behold, is Dauid not hiding among us in Messara in the narrows in New in the hill of Hechela, which is on the right of Iessaimoun?<verse eid="1SA 23:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:20"/>And now, as for everything that is on the king's mind for a descent, let him descend to us; they have shut him up into the king's hands."<verse eid="1SA 23:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:21"/>And Saoul said to them, "May you be blessed to the Lord, for you felt sorry for me!<verse eid="1SA 23:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:22"/>Do go, and make ready once more, and know his place where his foot will be, quickly there where you said, lest he be cunning.<verse eid="1SA 23:22"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:23"/>And look around, and know, and we will go with you, and it will be, if he is in the land, that I will search him out among all the thousands of Ioudas."<verse eid="1SA 23:23"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:24"/>And the Ziphites set out and went ahead of Saoul, and Dauid and his men were in the Maan wilderness in the evening to the right of Iessaimoun.<verse eid="1SA 23:24"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:25"/>And Saoul went, and his men, to search for him, and they reported to Dauid, and he went down to the rock that is in the wilderness of Maan. And Saoul heard and pursued after Dauid into the wilderness of Maan.<verse eid="1SA 23:25"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:26"/>And Saoul and his men went on one side of this mountain, and Dauid and his men were on the other side of this mountain. And Dauid was sheltering himself to get away from before Saoul, and Saoul and his men encamped against Dauid and his men to capture them.<verse eid="1SA 23:26"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:27"/>And a messenger came to Saoul, saying, "Hurry, and come, for the allophyles have made a raid on the land."<verse eid="1SA 23:27"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 23:28"/>And Saoul turned back from pursuing after Dauid and went to meet the allophyles; therefore that place was called the Divided Rock.<verse eid="1SA 23:28"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 24"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:1"/>(23.29) And Dauid went up from there and settled in the narrows of Engaddi.<verse eid="1SA 24:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:2"/>(24.1) And it happened, when Saoul returned from after the allophyles, that it was told him, saying, "Dauid is in the wilderness of Engaddi."<verse eid="1SA 24:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:3"/>(2) And he took with him three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to look for Dauid and his men in front of Sadaiem.<verse eid="1SA 24:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:4"/>(3) And he came to the flocks of herds that were beside the road, and a cave was there, and Saoul went in to prepare himself, and Dauid and his men were sitting in the inner part of the cave.<verse eid="1SA 24:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:5"/>(4) And Dauid's men said to him, "Behold, this is the day of which the Lord spoke to you to give your enemy into your hands, and you shall do to him as is good in your eyes." And Dauid arose and stealthily removed the wing of Saoul's double-cloak<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">24:5</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'double-cloak':  style of garment</char></note>.<verse eid="1SA 24:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:6"/>(5) And it happened after these things that Dauid's heart smote him, because he had removed the wing of his double-cloak<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">24:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'double-cloak':  style of garment</char></note>.<verse eid="1SA 24:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:7"/>(6) And Dauid said to his men, "Not at all is it to me from the Lord, if I shall do this thing to my lord, the Lord's anointed, to bring my hand against him, for this one is the Lord's anointed."<verse eid="1SA 24:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:8"/>(7) And Dauid persuaded his men with words and did not permit them to get up to put Saoul to death. And Saoul got up and went down to the road.<verse eid="1SA 24:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:9"/>(8) And Dauid got up after him out of the cave, and Dauid called after Saoul, saying, "My lord king!" And Saoul looked behind him, and Dauid bowed with his face to the ground and did obeisance to him.<verse eid="1SA 24:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:10"/>(9) And Dauid said to Saoul, "Why do you listen to the words of the people, saying, 'Behold, Dauid seeks your life'?<verse eid="1SA 24:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:11"/>(10) Behold, in this very day your eyes have seen how the Lord gave you today into my hand in the cave, and I was not willing to kill you, and I spared you and said, 'I will not raise my hand against my lord; for this one is the Lord's anointed.'<verse eid="1SA 24:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:12"/>(11) And behold, the wing of your double-cloak<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">24:12</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'double-cloak':  a style of garment</char></note> is in my hand; I have removed the wing, and I have not killed you, and know, and see today that there is no wrong or impiety and rebellion in my hand. And I have not sinned against you, and you are binding my life to take it.<verse eid="1SA 24:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:13"/>(12) May the Lord judge between me and you, and may the Lord avenge me on you, and my hand shall not be against you,<verse eid="1SA 24:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:14"/>(13) as the ancient illustration says, 'Out of the lawless will come forth error,' and my hand shall not be against you.<verse eid="1SA 24:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:15"/>(14) And now after whom do you come out O king of Israel? After whom do you pursue? After a dead dog and after one flea.<verse eid="1SA 24:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:16"/>(15) May the Lord be judge and jury between me and between you; may the Lord see and judge my cause and acquit me out of your hand."<verse eid="1SA 24:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:17"/>(16) And it happened, when Dauid had finished speaking these words to Saoul, that Saoul said, "Is this your voice, my child Dauid?" and Saoul lifted up his voice and wept.<verse eid="1SA 24:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:18"/>(17) And Saoul said to Dauid, "You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me good, but I have repaid you evil.<verse eid="1SA 24:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:19"/>(18) And today you have told me the good things that you have done for me, when the Lord shut me into your hands today and you did not kill me,<verse eid="1SA 24:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:20"/>(19) and that if one should find his enemy in distress and should send him on a good way, then the Lord will repay him good as you have done today.<verse eid="1SA 24:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:21"/>(20) And now, behold, I know that ruling you shall rule, and the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hands.<verse eid="1SA 24:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:22"/>(21) And now swear to me by the Lord that you will not utterly destroy my offspring after me and not wipe out my name from my father's house."<verse eid="1SA 24:22"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 24:23"/>(22) And Dauid swore to Saoul. And Saoul departed to his place, and Dauid and his men went up to the Messara narrow.<verse eid="1SA 24:23"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 25"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:1"/>And Samouel died, and all Israel assembled and mourned him, and they buried him at his home in Harmathaim. And Dauid got up and went down to the wilderness of Maan.<verse eid="1SA 25:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:2"/>And there was a man in Maan, and his flocks were in Carmel, and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and it happened when he was shearing his flock in Carmel.<verse eid="1SA 25:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:3"/>And the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Abigaia, and his wife was good at understanding and very beautiful in appearance, and the man was surly and mean in his practices, and the man was dog-like.<verse eid="1SA 25:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:4"/>And Dauid heard in the wilderness that Nabal the Carmelite was shearing his flock,<verse eid="1SA 25:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:5"/>and Dauid sent ten lads and said to the lads, "Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and ask him in my name regarding peace,<verse eid="1SA 25:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:6"/>and you shall say this: 'To good times; may you be in good health and your house, and all that you have be in good health!<verse eid="1SA 25:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:7"/>And now, behold, I have heard that they are shearing for you-- now your shepherds who were with us in the wilderness, and we did not hinder them and did not demand anything of them, all the days they were in Carmel.<verse eid="1SA 25:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:8"/>Ask your lads, and they will tell you. And let my lads find favor in your sight, for we have come on a good day. Do give whatever your hand finds to your son Dauid.' "<verse eid="1SA 25:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:9"/>And the lads came and spoke these words to Nabal according to all these words in the name of Dauid. And he leaped up,<verse eid="1SA 25:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:10"/>and Nabal answered Dauid's servants and said, "Who is Dauid? And who is the son of Iessai? Slaves have been multiplied today, when they are breaking away each from before his master.<verse eid="1SA 25:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:11"/>And shall I take my bread and my wine and my sacrifices, the sheep that I have sacrificed for my shearers, and give them to men who come from I do not know where?"<verse eid="1SA 25:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:12"/>And Dauid's lads turned away on their way and returned and came and told Dauid according to these words.<verse eid="1SA 25:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:13"/>And Dauid said to his men, "Each strap on his sword!" and about four hundred men went up after Dauid, and the two hundred remained with the baggage.<verse eid="1SA 25:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:14"/>And one of the lads told Abigaia, Nabal's wife, saying, "Behold, Dauid sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master, and he turned away from them.<verse eid="1SA 25:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:15"/>And the men were very good to us; they did not hinder us nor make demands on us, and when we were in the fields,<verse eid="1SA 25:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:16"/>they were like a wall around us both by night and by day, during all the days that we were with them keeping the flock.<verse eid="1SA 25:16"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 25:18"/>And Abigaia hurried and took two hundred loaves and two vessels of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five oiphi<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">25:18</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 ephah = 22 liters</char></note> of parched grain and one gomor<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">25:18</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Hebrew 1 omer = 22 liters; Hebrew 1 homer = 220 liters</char></note> of raisins and two hundred cakes of dried fruit and put them on the donkeys<verse eid="1SA 25:18"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 25:20"/>And it happened, when she was mounted on the donkey and was going down under cover of the mountain, that, behold, Dauid and his men were coming down to meet her, and she met them.<verse eid="1SA 25:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:21"/>And Dauid said, "Perchance for an unrighteous fellow I have protected all his belongings in the wilderness, and we have not ordered to receive anything of all his belongings, and he has returned me evil for good.<verse eid="1SA 25:21"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 25:30"/>And it will be that the Lord will do to my lord all the good that he spoke concerning you, and the Lord will command you to be leader over Israel,<verse eid="1SA 25:30"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 25:32"/>And Dauid said to Abigaia, "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent you to meet me on this very day,<verse eid="1SA 25:32"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:33"/>and blessed be your character, and blessed be you who has hindered me on this very day so as not to come into spilling of blood and to save my hand for myself!<verse eid="1SA 25:33"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:34"/>For surely the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, who has hindered me today from hurting you, because if you had not hurried and come to meet me, then I had said, 'If by morning light there would have been left to Nabal one who urinates against a wall<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">25:34</char><char closed="false" style="ft">I.e.

    <verse sid="1SA 25:35"/>And Dauid received from her hand all that she had brought him, and he said to her, "Go up to your house in peace; see, I have heeded your voice, and I have chosen your face."<verse eid="1SA 25:35"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:36"/>And Abigaia came to Nabal, and behold, he had a feast in his house like a feast of a king, and Nabal's heart was merry upon him, and he was exceedingly drunk, and she did not tell him a word small or great until the morning light.<verse eid="1SA 25:36"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:37"/>And it happened in the morning, when Nabal had sobered up from the wine, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became like a stone.<verse eid="1SA 25:37"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:38"/>And it happened about ten days later, and the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.<verse eid="1SA 25:38"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:39"/>And Dauid heard and said, "Blessed be the Lord who has judged the cause of my reproach at Nabal's hand and has kept back his slave from the hand of evil acts, and the Lord has returned the evildoing of Nabal upon his head." And Dauid sent and spoke concerning Abigaia to take her to himself as a wife.<verse eid="1SA 25:39"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:40"/>And Dauid's servants came to Abigaia at Carmel and spoke to her, saying, "Dauid sent us to you to take you to him as a wife."<verse eid="1SA 25:40"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:41"/>And she rose and did obeisance, face to the ground, and said, "Behold, your slave is for a servant-girl to wash the feet of your servants."<verse eid="1SA 25:41"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:42"/>And Abigaia arose and mounted the donkey and five maids were attending her, and she went after the servants of Dauid and became his wife.<verse eid="1SA 25:42"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:43"/>And Dauid took Achinaam from Iezrael, and both were his wives.<verse eid="1SA 25:43"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 25:44"/>And Saoul gave his daughter Melchol, Dauid's wife, to Phalti son of Lais, who was from Romma.<verse eid="1SA 25:44"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 26"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:1"/>And the Ziphites came from the dry country to Saoul on the hill, saying, "Behold, Dauid is sheltering with us on the hill of Hechela, which is in front of Iessaimoun."<verse eid="1SA 26:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:2"/>And Saoul rose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, and with him were three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek Dauid in the wilderness of Ziph.<verse eid="1SA 26:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:3"/>And Saoul encamped on the hill of Hechela in front of Iessaimoun beside the road, and Dauid settled in the wilderness. And Dauid saw that Saoul had come after him into the wilderness,<verse eid="1SA 26:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:4"/>and Dauid sent out spies and learned that Saoul had come prepared from Keila.<verse eid="1SA 26:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:5"/>And Dauid rose secretly and went in to the place, there where Saoul was sleeping, and Abenner son of Ner, the commander-in-chief of his army, was there, and Saoul was sleeping in a covered chariot, and the people were encamped around him.<verse eid="1SA 26:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:6"/>And Dauid answered and said to Achimelech the Chettite and to Ioab's brother Abessa son of Sarouia, saying "Who will enter with me into the camp to Saoul?" And Abessa said, "I will enter with you."<verse eid="1SA 26:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:7"/>And Dauid went in, and Abessa, to the people by night, and behold, Saoul lay in sleep in a covered chariot, and his spear stuck in the ground at his head, and Abenner and his people were sleeping around him.<verse eid="1SA 26:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:8"/>And Abessa said to Dauid, "The Lord has shut up your enemy into your hand today, and now I will pin him to the ground with the spear once, and I will not strike him a second time."<verse eid="1SA 26:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:9"/>And Dauid said to Abessa, "Do not humble him, for who shall bring his hand against the Lord's anointed and be guiltless?"<verse eid="1SA 26:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:10"/>And Dauid said, "The Lord lives, if the Lord does not strike him down or his day comes and he dies or he goes down into battle and is added,<verse eid="1SA 26:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:11"/>it is certainly not from the Lord to bring my hand against the Lord's anointed, and now do take the spear from by his head, and the jar of water, and let us depart by ourselves."<verse eid="1SA 26:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:12"/>And Dauid took the spear and the jar of water from by his head, and they went away by themselves. And there was no one to see it and no one to know it and no one to awaken; all were sleeping, because amazement from the Lord had fallen upon them.<verse eid="1SA 26:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:13"/>And Dauid went over to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain far away, and the distance between them was great.<verse eid="1SA 26:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:14"/>And Dauid called to the people, and he spoke to Abenner, saying, "Abenner! Will you not answer?" And Abenner answered and said, "Who are you that calls me?"<verse eid="1SA 26:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:15"/>And Dauid said to Abenner, "Are you not a man? And who is like you in Israel? And why do you not keep watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy your lord the king.<verse eid="1SA 26:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:16"/>And this thing that you have done is not good. The Lord lives, because you who guard our lord the king, the Lord's anointed, are sons of execution. And now do see! Where are the king's spear and the jar of water that are at his head?"<verse eid="1SA 26:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:17"/>And Saoul recognized Dauid's voice and said, "Is this your voice, my child Dauid?" And Dauid said, "Your slave, O lord the king."<verse eid="1SA 26:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:18"/>And he said, "Why does my lord thus pursue after his slave? For what have I done wrong? And what injustice was found in me?<verse eid="1SA 26:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:19"/>And now do let my lord the king hear the word of his slave: if it is God who stirs you up against me, may he get scent of your offering, and if it is sons of men, may they be cursed before the Lord, for they have driven me out today so as not to be established in the heritage of the Lord, saying, 'Go, be subject to other gods.'<verse eid="1SA 26:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:20"/>And now, may my blood not fall to the ground opposite the presence of the Lord, for the king of Israel has come out to seek my life, as the long-eared owl hunts on the mountains."<verse eid="1SA 26:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:21"/>And Saoul said, "I have done wrong; come back, my child Dauid, for I will not harm you, because my life was precious in your eyes in this very day; I have been a no-good and have acted in very great ignorance."<verse eid="1SA 26:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:22"/>And Dauid answered and said, "Behold, the spear of the king! Let one of the lads come over and get it.<verse eid="1SA 26:22"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:23"/>And the Lord will return to each his righteous deeds and his faith, as the Lord gave you into my hand today, and I did not want to bring my hand against the Lord's anointed,<verse eid="1SA 26:23"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:24"/>and behold, as your life was magnified today in my eyes in this very day, so may my life be magnified before the Lord, and may he protect me, and he will deliver me from all tribulation."<verse eid="1SA 26:24"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 26:25"/>And Saoul said to Dauid, "Blessed be you, my child. And doing you will do, and succeeding you will succeed." And Dauid went on his way, and Saoul returned to his place.<verse eid="1SA 26:25"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 27"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:1"/>And Dauid said in his heart, saying, "I shall now be added in one day into the hands of Saoul, and there is no good for me, unless I escape to a land of allophyles and Saoul ceases from seeking me within every border of Israel, and I shall escape out of his hand."<verse eid="1SA 27:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:2"/>And Dauid and the four hundred men with him arose and came to Anchous son of Ammach, king of Geth.<verse eid="1SA 27:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:3"/>And Dauid settled with Anchous at Geth, he and his men, each and his household, and Dauid and both his wives, Achinaam the Iezraelite and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.<verse eid="1SA 27:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:4"/>And it was told Saoul that Dauid had fled to Geth, and he no longer added to seek him.<verse eid="1SA 27:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:5"/><verse eid="1SA 27:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:6"/>And Dauid said to Anchous, "If indeed your slave has found favor in your eyes, do let them give me a place in one of the towns that are in the country, and I will settle there, and why does your slave settle in a royal city with you?" (6) And in that day he gave him Sekelak; therefore Sekelak has belonged to the king of Judea to this day.<verse eid="1SA 27:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:7"/>And the number of days that Dauid was settled in the country of the allophyles was four months.<verse eid="1SA 27:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:8"/>And Dauid was going up, and his men, and they were making raids on every Gesiri and on the Amalekite, and behold, the land was being inhabited-- the land from Gelampsour even as far as the land of Egypt-- by suitable walled places<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">27:8</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Lacking in Greek</char></note>.<verse eid="1SA 27:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:9"/>And he was striking the land and not leaving man or woman alive and was taking away flocks and herds and donkeys and camels and clothing, and they returned and were coming to Anchous.<verse eid="1SA 27:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:10"/>And Anchous said to Dauid, "Against whom have you made a raid today?" And Dauid said to Anchous, "Against the south of Judea and against the south of Iesmega and against the south of Kenezi."<verse eid="1SA 27:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:11"/>And he left neither man nor woman alive to bring back to Geth, saying, "They must not bring word to Geth against us, saying, 'This is what Dauid does.' " And this was his rationale all the days that Dauid was settled in the country of the allophyles.<verse eid="1SA 27:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 27:12"/>And Dauid was fully trusted with Anchous, saying, "Shaming he has made himself shamed among his people in Israel, and he shall always be a slave to me."<verse eid="1SA 27:12"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 28"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:1"/>And it happened in those days that allophyles were gathering in their camps to go out to fight with Israel, and Anchous said to Dauid, "Knowing you shall know that you will go out with me to battle, you and your men."<verse eid="1SA 28:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:2"/>And Dauid said to Anchous, "Thus now you shall know what your slave will do," and Anchous said to Dauid, "So I will make you chief of the bodyguard all the days."<verse eid="1SA 28:2"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:3"/>And Samouel died, and all Israel mourned for him and buried him in Harmathaim in his city. And Saoul expelled the ventriloquists and those in the know from the land.<verse eid="1SA 28:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:4"/>And the allophyles assembled and came and encamped at Soman, and Saoul gathered every man of Israel, and they encamped at Gelboue.<verse eid="1SA 28:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:5"/>And Saoul saw the camp of the allophyles and was afraid, and his heart was greatly dismayed.<verse eid="1SA 28:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:6"/>And Saoul inquired through the Lord, and the Lord did not answer him by dreams and by clear ones<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">28:6</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'clear ones':  Possibly 'explaining devices'</char></note> and by prophets.<verse eid="1SA 28:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:7"/>And Saoul said to his servants, "Seek out for me a ventriloquizing woman, and I will go to her and inquire by her," and his servants said to him, "Behold, there is a ventriloquizing woman at Aendor."<verse eid="1SA 28:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:8"/>And Saoul disguised himself and put on other clothes and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night, and he said to her, "Do seek divinations for me by a ventriloquist, and bring up for me whomever I say to you."<verse eid="1SA 28:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:9"/>And the woman said to him, "Behold, indeed you know what Saoul did, how he cut off the ventriloquists and those in the know from the land, and why are you laying a snare for my life to put it to death?"<verse eid="1SA 28:9"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:10"/>And Saoul swore to her, saying, "The Lord lives, if injustice shall befall you in this matter."<verse eid="1SA 28:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:11"/>And the woman said, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" And he said, "Bring up Samouel for me."<verse eid="1SA 28:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:12"/>And the woman saw Samouel, and she cried out with a loud voice, and the woman said to Saoul, "Why did you deceive me? And you are Saoul!"<verse eid="1SA 28:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:13"/>And the king said to her, "Have no fear; tell whom you have seen." And she said to him, "I have seen gods coming up out of the ground."<verse eid="1SA 28:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:14"/>And he said to her, "What did you perceive?" And she said to him, "A man, standing, coming up out of the ground, and he is wrapped in a double-cloak<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">28:14</char><char closed="false" style="ft">'double-cloak':  a style of garment</char></note>." And Saoul knew that this was Samouel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and did obeisance to him.<verse eid="1SA 28:14"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:15"/>And Samouel said, "Why did you disturb me that I ascend?" And Saoul said, "I am greatly distressed, and the allophyles are warring against me, and God has turned away from me and no longer heeds me, either by the hand of prophets or by dreams, and now I have summoned you to tell me what I shall<note caller="▼" style="f"><char closed="false" style="fr">28:15</char><char closed="false" style="ft">Or 'must'</char></note> do."<verse eid="1SA 28:15"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:16"/>And Samouel said, "Why do you inquire of me? And the Lord has turned from you and is with your neighbor,<verse eid="1SA 28:16"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:17"/>and the Lord has done to you just as he spoke by my hand, and the Lord will tear your kingdom out of your hand and give it to your neighbor Dauid.<verse eid="1SA 28:17"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:18"/>Because you did not hear the voice of the Lord and did not carry out his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore the Lord did this thing to you this day.<verse eid="1SA 28:18"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:19"/>And the Lord will hand over Israel along with you into the hands of allophyles, and tomorrow you and your sons with you shall fall, and the Lord will give the camp of Israel into the hands of allophyles."<verse eid="1SA 28:19"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:20"/>And Saoul hastened, and as he stood, he fell on the ground and was filled with fear because of the words of Samouel, and there was no more any strength in him, for he had eaten nothing the whole day and that whole night.<verse eid="1SA 28:20"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:21"/>And the woman came to Saoul and saw that he hastened greatly and said to him, "Behold, indeed your slave heard your voice, and I put my life in my hand and heard the words that you spoke to me,<verse eid="1SA 28:21"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:22"/>and now do listen to the voice of your slave, and I will set a morsel of bread before you, and eat, and there will be strength in you for you will go on the way."<verse eid="1SA 28:22"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:23"/>And he did not want to eat, and his servants and the woman were urging him, and he listened to their voice and got up from the ground and sat on the seat.<verse eid="1SA 28:23"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:24"/>And the woman had a grazing heifer in the house, and she hastened and slaughtered it and took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened cakes<verse eid="1SA 28:24"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 28:25"/>and brought them before Saoul and before his servants, and they ate. And they rose and went away that night.<verse eid="1SA 28:25"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 29:1"/>And allophyles gathered all their armies at Aphek, and Israel encamped in Aendor which is in Iezrael.<verse eid="1SA 29:1"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 29:3"/>and the satraps of the allophyles said, "Who are these who pass by?" And Anchous said to the commanders of the allophyles, "Is this not Dauid, the slave of King Saoul of Israel? He has been with us for days; this is the second year, and from the day he fell in with me I have found no fault in him and until this day."<verse eid="1SA 29:3"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 29:4"/>And the commanders of the allophyles were distressed by him and said to him, "Return the man to his place, there where you have assigned him, and let him not go with us to the battle, and let him not be a plotter against the camp, and by what means could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of those men?<verse eid="1SA 29:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 29:5"/>Is this not Dauid, for whom they began with dances, saying, 'Saoul has killed amongst his thousands, and Dauid amongst his ten thousands'?"<verse eid="1SA 29:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 29:6"/>And Anchous called Dauid and said to him, "The Lord lives, that you and your coming in and your going out with me in the camp are right and good in my eyes and that I have not found evil against you from the day you have come to me until the present day, and in the eyes of the satraps you are not good.<verse eid="1SA 29:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 29:7"/>And now go back, and go in peace, and you shall not do evil in the eyes of the satraps of the allophyles."<verse eid="1SA 29:7"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 29:8"/>And Dauid said to Anchous, "What have I done to you, and what did you find in your slave from the day I was before you even until this day, that I shall not go to fight the enemies of my lord the king?"<verse eid="1SA 29:8"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 29:9"/>And Anchous replied to Dauid, "I know that you are good in my eyes, but the satraps of the allophyles say, 'He shall not go up with us to battle.'<verse eid="1SA 29:9"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 29:11"/>And Dauid was early to depart, he and his men, and to guard the land of the allophyles, and the allophyles went up to fight against Israel.<verse eid="1SA 29:11"/>



  <chapter sid="1SA 30"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 30:1"/>And it happened, when Dauid and his men entered into Sekelak on the third day, that Amalek had made a raid on the south and on Sekelak and had struck Sekelak and burned it with fire,<verse eid="1SA 30:1"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 30:2"/>and with respect to the women and all that was in it, from small up to great, they did not put to death man or woman, but took them captive and went on their way.<verse eid="1SA 30:2"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 30:4"/>And Dauid raised, and his men, their voice, and they wept until they had no more strength left to weep.<verse eid="1SA 30:4"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 30:5"/>And both Dauid's wives were taken captive, Achinoom the Iezraelite and Abigaia the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.<verse eid="1SA 30:5"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 30:6"/>And Dauid was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was in great pain each for his sons and for his daughters, and Dauid was strengthened in the Lord, his God.<verse eid="1SA 30:6"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 30:7"/>And Dauid said to the priest, Abiathar son of Achimelech, "Bring the ephoud."<verse eid="1SA 30:7"/>

    <verse sid="1SA 30:10"/>And he pursued with four hundred men, but two hundred stayed behind, who stayed on the other side of Wadi Bosor.<verse eid="1SA 30:10"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 30:11"/>And in the open country they found an Egyptian man, and they took him and brought him to Dauid in the open country, and they gave him bread, and he ate, and they gave him water to drink,<verse eid="1SA 30:11"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 30:12"/>and they gave him a piece of fig cake, and he ate, and his spirit revived in him, for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.<verse eid="1SA 30:12"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 30:13"/>And Dauid said to him, "Whose are you, and where are you from?" And the Egyptian lad said, "I am a slave of an Amalekite man, and my master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago.<verse eid="1SA 30:13"/>
    <verse sid="1SA 30:14"/>And we had made a raid on the south of Cholthi and on the parts of Judea and on the south of Cheloub, and we burned Sekelak with fire."<verse eid="1SA 30:14"/>
